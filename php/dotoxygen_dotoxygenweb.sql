(67, 1, 'DotOxygen', '30.08.2022', 'Custom Construction Software Price, Advantages Implementation', '<p>Numerous intricate techniques are used in the construction business. Construction software is required to streamline these procedures and increase corporate effectiveness. We will discuss the sorts of custom software, the development process, and the advantages of custom construction software in our newest blog article today.</p>\r\n \r\n<H3>Let\'s start now!</H3>\r\n \r\n<h5>What is Software for Customized Construction?</h5>\r\n \r\n<p>Software for the construction industry that is specifically designed to replace manual chores with a set of digital tools that are centrally located and constantly under surveillance. Time is saved, mistakes are decreased, and profitability is increased.</p>\r\n<p>Software for the construction industry is created just for you, your demands, and the needs of your company. The key benefit of customization is that it allows you to choose what should and shouldn\'t be included in the system because the program is made just for you.</p>\r\n \r\n<p>Changing to a personalized digital solution could alter your business. You can quickly learn the status of your projects and make more informed decisions on the spot thanks to the way it compiles all of your data sources into a \"single source of truth.\"</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Think about what would happen if a worker missed work due to an illness and failed to bring the required documentation. If a replacement employee needs to be allocated in their place, an automatic push message may let you know right away.</p>\r\n \r\n<p>That is but one instance of how specialized construction management software might be useful. Consider all the chores that specialized software can help you with.</p>\r\n\r\n<h5>What distinguishes ready-made software from custom construction software?</h5>\r\n<p>You may wonder why waste time developing unique construction software when there are so many ready-made options available. There are several pre-made software options available nowadays. Let\'s examine the primary distinctions between tailored and off-the-shelf construction software instead:</p>\r\n\r\n<h6>Functional</h6>\r\n<p>The fact that custom building software is uniquely adapted to business demands and flow is by far its greatest benefit. To match the system\'s functionality to the problems your business solves, you can add any functions.</p>\r\n \r\n<p>Ready-made solutions don\'t always fit the needs of a specific business. Additionally, commercially available solutions frequently demand payment for services that the business won\'t use, and the plan frequently excludes some extra functions that are necessary for work.</p>\r\n\r\n<h6>Adherence to business requirements</h6>\r\n<p>A certain company\'s needs and specifications are completely met by customized building software. Custom building software will fully take into consideration any unique traits that your business may have.</p>\r\n \r\n<p>Ready-made software typically only meets the most fundamental demands and specifications without allowing for individual component customization.</p>\r\n\r\n<h6>Price</h6>\r\n<p>You don\'t have to pay for a subscription license while using software for bespoke creation. However, if you select a pre-made solution, you will have to pay for it, and the cost will vary depending on the license\'s specifics and the plan you select.</p>\r\n \r\n<p>Depending on the specific features you desire in your system, custom construction software development costs will vary. Later, we\'ll go into greater detail about this.</p>\r\n \r\n<h6>Comfort and adaptability</h6>\r\n \r\n<p>The company\'s strategic development plans are taken into account via custom construction software. Additionally, the software\'s capabilities can be enhanced in any direction as needed. Additionally, specialized software is created so that it is practical for you to utilize.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Ready-made software has a set, constant structure, and functioning. In other words, it\'s doubtful that you\'ll be able to adapt the system to your adjustments if your business grows quickly. You\'ll need to find a new one.</p>\r\n\r\n<h6>Updates and assistance</h6>\r\n<p>The development team will complete any system updates you require because the custom construction software is made specifically for you. In the event of potential system faults or malfunctions, assistance will also be given.</p>\r\n \r\n<p>Offline updates are performed manually and automatically on ready-made software. Standard functionality is one of the key drawbacks of ready-made software. At first glance, there appear to be numerous (and sometimes even too many) functions, but in reality, some won\'t be used at all, and others important to the operation of the business will be overlooked.</p>\r\n\r\n<h6>Business perspective</h6>\r\n<p>Because it can automate processes like sales, marketing, notifications, customer service, analytics, etc., custom-built software completely outperforms other options in terms of business prospects. That is, a system like this will enable you to enhance company procedures and so boost productivity.</p>\r\n \r\n<p>Because they only address the fundamental requirements of various enterprises, ready-made solutions don\'t always let you do certain sorts of automation. That is to say, ready-made software won\'t do anything for your prospects or progress.</p>\r\n\r\n<h6>Time for action</h6>\r\n<p>Launching pre-made software and connecting its elements requires less time. Custom construction software may require more time to implement. This will take place, nevertheless, more accurately and deeply.</p>\r\n \r\n<h6>System performance</h6>\r\n<p>Because you can implement and integrate as many tools and third-party plugins as you need, custom construction software performs better. Because a system like this starts with fewer capabilities, its efficiency will be lower.</p>\r\n \r\n<h6>Data security and discretion</h6>\r\n<p>The system owner is in charge of data protection if you select a pre-made solution. We believe that this is not a 100% reliable choice.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>When it comes to specialized building software, data can be kept both on the servers of the developer (to which only the business will have access) and those of the client. It is safer and more dependable.</p>\r\n\r\n<h5>Exactly who requires specialized construction management software?</h5>\r\n<p>Let\'s examine who specifically needs to consider the creation of bespoke construction software:</p>\r\n \r\n<h6>A company that aims to expand quickly</h6>\r\n \r\n<p>You should consider developing custom construction software if you want your company to expand and scale quickly. By using such a system, you will be able to speed up most of your work procedures, which will subsequently speed up the growth of your company.</p>\r\n \r\n<h6>Businesses that value data security</h6>\r\n<p>The security of their data is a concern for the majority of construction companies. If your business fits this description, then custom construction software will be able to offer you dependable and secure data storage.</p>\r\n<p>All contracts, papers, invoices, and other crucial items for your company will be kept secure, out of the hands of thieves and hackers.</p>\r\n\r\n<h6>Businesses aiming for the highest levels of process optimization and efficiency</h6>\r\n<p>Custom construction software may be wholly relied upon by businesses looking to optimize their operations, and as we all know, there are many intricate processes involved in the construction industry.</p>\r\n \r\n<p>Such software will assist you in automating chores that you previously performed by hand. The effectiveness of your company will therefore rise as a result.</p>\r\n \r\n<h6>Businesses that are unhappy with the inadequate or superfluous functionality of ready-made solutions</h6>\r\n<p>For people who are unhappy with the functionality and capabilities offered by pre-made solutions, custom-built software is required.</p>\r\n \r\n<p>As we previously stated, pre-made solutions may not always be able to give you the functionality that your company requires. Additionally, specialized software will contain the features you need.</p>\r\n\r\n<h6>Businesses who aim to prevent duplication by combining many data sources into one system</h6>\r\n<p>You need custom construction software if your organization currently employs several business process management systems and frequently gets confused about what belongs where. Such software will be a centralized location where you may keep all the tools and data you require.</p>\r\n \r\n<h6>Executives who must successfully digitize their companies</h6>\r\n<p>Start with a bespoke construction company if you are a business owner who wishes to implement a digital transformation within your organization. You can shift all of your work-related responsibilities to one system using such a system, which will carry out the majority of them automatically.</p>\r\n\r\n<h6>Managers who require seamless interaction with external tools</h6>\r\n<p>You can combine the majority of third-party services with custom construction software. Therefore, you should consider developing bespoke construction software if your business uses such services and you want to integrate them with your existing system.</p>\r\n \r\n<h6>Choose Your Custom Construction Software Type</h6>\r\n\r\n<p>Custom construction software comes in a wide variety of forms. Let\'s examine the primary ones so you can select the best option for your business:</p>\r\n \r\n<h6>ERP software for specialised construction</h6>\r\n<p>A complete business management solution is called an ERP system, or enterprise resource planning. Large volumes of data may be processed and stored with these information systems. Through the use of customized ERP software and an integrated approach to automation:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Combine all business processes of the company into a single program</li>\r\n<li>quickly receive information about business activities</li>\r\n<li>monitor the work of all departments</li>\r\n<li>streamline departmental communications</li>\r\n<li>plan the company\'s material requirements</li>\r\n<li>monitor transactions</li>\r\n<li>lower operating costs</li>\r\n<li>facilitate customer communications</li>\r\n</ul>', '123456-custom_construction_software_price_advantages_implementation.jpg', 'Branding, Website Design, Website Development, User Interface, User Experience', '2022-08-30 14:18:33.64235', '30.08.2022'),
(70, 2, 'DotOxygen', '30.08.2022', 'Dedicated Team Model. Everything You Need to Know', '<p>Software development engagement model selection is a complicated process that requires thorough and serious thought. Knowing a model\'s advantages and disadvantages, as well as the situations in which to apply it, are essential if you want to maximize profits and minimize dangers.</p>\r\n \r\n<p>You can learn everything there is to know about the Dedicated Team Engagement Model from this page. If not all of your questions, then the vast majority of them should be addressed by it. Start now.</p>\r\n \r\n<h5>What does a devoted team model entail?</h5>\r\n<p>A dedicated development team is a designated team of remote workers who are entirely committed to you and your project, as the name implies. Dedicated team functions as a distinct entity as opposed to an extended team, which is an addition to your core development teams. Such a team typically consists of PMs, QA engineers, designers, and other professionals in addition to developers.</p>\r\n \r\n<p>Regularly and exclusively working full-time for one customer, a devoted staff gives the client\'s project their complete focus. This is what commitment looks like.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The service provider, on the other hand, acts as a go-between in this collaboration, delivering services like hiring and providing the tools required to complete the project.</p>\r\n \r\n<p>In comparison to when using other models, the client also has a lot more management power. Typically, the customer can manage the team members and their daily duties and easily track the team\'s performance and development.<p>\r\n<h5>What Is the Process of the Dedicated Team Model?</h5>\r\n<p>Here is a step-by-step breakdown of the entire procedure:<p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Everything begins with the client, who must determine what he or she needs. It is crucial to determine the approximate number of people and the technical expertise required for the project. </li>\r\n<li>The service provider then chooses the most qualified, committed team to meet all of the client\'s criteria. The customer can interview the applicants and select the top ones. </li>\r\n<li>The team and the client then settle on the precise time frame for the project\'s implementation as well as the anticipated workload.</li>\r\n<li>After the criteria have been established, the workflow begins, and hired employees work regular hours just like the traditional in-house staff.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>In actuality, the client has complete authority over the project and is in command of all working procedures. The team and its workflow can be managed and monitored by the client.</p>\r\n\r\n<h5>The Dedicated Team Model\'s benefits</h5>\r\n\r\n<p>The following are some of the most significant benefits that the Dedicated Team Model provides:</p>\r\n \r\n<h6>Cost-Efficiency</h6>\r\n<p>DT is a financially sound alternative. For instance, hiring a dedicated team is not only faster but also far less expensive than manually compiling a suitable team on your own. Just take into account how occasionally the hiring procedure can affect the budget. Finding the correct specialists, interviewing them, and attempting to include each of them individually in your company strategy are not simple tasks.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Here, a specialized team model appears more appealing. There is already a team available that perfectly satisfies the requirements of your project, so there will be no rush. These individuals operate as a single unit and are skilled at working together to accomplish your objective. Additionally, there is no need to waste money on hiring.</p>\r\n\r\n<h6>Wonderful Flexibility</h6>\r\n<p>The specialized team\'s ability to be reorganized whenever necessary offers incredible flexibility. You are free to manage your team and alter its makeup at any point in the development process, regardless of whether you are facing financial difficulties or wish to use new technologies for your project.</p>\r\n\r\n<h6>Total Command</h6>\r\n<p>You have complete managerial control over your team members if you select the dedicated team model. You may manage the workload, performance, and progress of the task by keeping an eye on workflow transparency. With the committed team\'s assistance, you can build whatever you want.</p>\r\n<p>Additionally, as was already mentioned, the committed team is entirely committed to you and your project, and they make every effort to help you reach your objectives. They don\'t collaborate with any other clients or work on any other projects. It is entirely up to you to decide how to spend your time.</p>\r\n\r\n<h6>Effective Cooperation</h6>\r\n<p>A long-term commitment results from the model\'s ability to take the customer and hired employees\' collaboration to a whole new level. The dedicated professionals interact with your company\'s culture and work to better understand your objectives and methods for achieving them because the dedicated team model calls for long-term collaboration and a commitment to the project. The hired staff can involve themselves in the project and provide helpful thoughts, rather than just following instructions and doing what you ask.</p>\r\n<p>Such a partnership not only saves time and money but frequently results in the development of some very amazing digital goods.</p>\r\n\r\n<h6>The Dedicated Team Model\'s drawbacks</h6>\r\n<p>The specialized team model has its drawbacks as well, so you should be aware of them before deciding to use it.</p>\r\n<h6>Low effectiveness in the short term</h6>\r\n<p>When you are unsure of the specifics, dates, and scope of your project, the dedicated team model works best for long-term initiatives. With this paradigm, you are free to experiment and alter the development process as you see fit. A set fee approach could appear like a preferable choice for short-term projects.</p>\r\n\r\n<h6>Your time is Required.</h6>\r\n<p>You commit to devoting a specified amount of your time to managing the development process if you select the dedicated team option. This was mentioned in the section on positives, but if you are not prepared to invest your time managing the team, it could appear as a downside.</p>\r\n \r\n<h6>Time-zone and cultural differences</h6>\r\n<p>Your service provider and you are likely located in various time zones, if not locations on the planet. All of these could cause issues with the scheduling and real-time communication. Additionally, how well you work together and how well the team members understand your demands are always impacted by cultural and religious differences.\r\nKeep in mind that effective cooperation requires the cooperation of both sides.</p>\r\n \r\n<h5>When Does the Committed Team Model Work the Best?</h5>\r\n<p>Be sure to understand the ideal setting for a certain model before choosing it. As a result, you won\'t take unneeded chances or get confused. The devoted team model performs admirably in the following circumstances:</p>\r\n<h6>You\'re still unsure of the outcome.</h6>\r\n<p>A dedicated team model is appropriate for you if you have a business plan but still do not have a clear understanding of the project scope, budget, or deadline. You can begin collaborating with the team, achieving your desired goals, and making discoveries to choose your course of action. With the model, you are free to make adjustments as the project develops. To avoid wasting resources and ultimately coming to a dead end, make sure to at least have a rough plan and be aware of some potential development routes.</p>\r\n\r\n<h6>Projects Over the Long Term That Are Likely to Grow</h6>\r\n<p>Long-term projects allow the devoted team model to reach its full potential. This plan is the best choice for you if you anticipate that your project will eventually develop and expand. You can gather fresh, necessary experts to meet your development needs without having to engage in continual recruitment. Additionally, your collaboration gets even more effective the longer you work with a team.</p>\r\n\r\n<h6>Constant Workflow Projects</h6>\r\n<p>If you choose the devoted team model, you must engage a sizable group of specialists who are paid for regular hours and provide them with something to do. You must maintain a steady workload for your project to avoid going into the red.</p>\r\n<p><strong>If the dedicated team model is inappropriate</strong></p>\r\n<p>Similar to this, the following situations may not lend themselves to the specialized team model:</p>\r\n \r\n<h6>You Have a Quick Project.</h6>\r\n<p>You can simply engage a development company to carry out your short-term project if you want it to be small-scale and not eventually expand. A specialized team approach, which is more advantageous during long-term development and continual expansion, is probably not appropriate in this scenario.</p>\r\n\r\n<h6>The Project\'s Scope Is Clear</h6>\r\n<p>The dedicated team model is generally not your best option if you have a thorough plan for your project and are certain the scope won\'t alter. It is preferable to use the fixed price model and avoid wasting time on pointless development process management.</p>\r\n \r\n<h6>The service provider is not trusted</h6>\r\n<p>It may sound simplistic, but there is merit to the claim that if you don\'t trust the vendor, you shouldn\'t select this model. Since the dedicated team model necessitates close engagement with the assigned professionals, you should put your trust in them and delegate your project to them. The knowledge required for product creation must be shared. If not, the group won\'t be able to assist you in reaching your objectives.</p>\r\n \r\n<p>To determine whether these folks are reliable, look at the vendor\'s reviews on websites like Clutch or GoodFirms.</p>\r\n', '123456-dedicated_team_model_everything_you_need_to_know.jpg', 'Branding, Website Design, Website Development, User Interface, User Experience', '2022-08-30 14:17:11.48445', '30.08.2022'),
(72, 3, 'DotOxygen', '30.08.2022', 'E-commerce Website Redesign in 2022 Guide for Owners ', '<h5>E-commerce Redesigned Website: Overview</h5>\r\n<p>In the contemporary world, where success depends on standing out, design is essential. You now market the user experience rather than the actual goods. Therefore, if your website is outdated or difficult to use, potential buyers will go elsewhere.</p>\r\n \r\n<p>But not all companies are aware of it. The same design templates are utilized by the majority of e-commerce sites. It is easy to use, affordable, and seems to perform well.</p>\r\n \r\n<p>But keep in mind that investing time, money, and effort into the design is necessary if you want to develop a close relationship with your customers and build a strong client base.</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>How can you tell if your e-commerce website needs to be redesigned?</li>\r\n<li>How can you successfully redesign it?</li>\r\n<li>What is the price?</li>\r\n<li>What are the crucial phases of redesigning an e-commerce website?</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>We will answer these and other queries in this blog.</p>\r\n \r\n<h6>Let\'s start with the fundamentals</h6>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>how do you know when you need to remodel your e-commerce website?</li>\r\n<li>Why Should Your E-Commerce Website Be Redesigned?</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>E-commerce platforms require modification for several reasons. However, we will pay special attention to factors like low conversion, poor UX, business scaling, intense market competition, etc.</p>\r\n \r\n<h5>How can a redesign of an e-commerce website address all these problems?</h5>\r\n<p>Let\'s together research this.</p>\r\n \r\n<h6>1. Your platform\'s conversion rate is low.</h6>\r\n<p>First off, a poor conversion rate indicates that your e-commerce platform is not very profitable. This problem must therefore be resolved. So, if you have trouble getting website visitors to buy something, you might want to think about redesigning your online store.</p>\r\n<p>Your platform\'s poor performance, restricted functionality, and unclear navigation all have a direct impact on conversion rates.</p>\r\n<p>Fortunately, e-commerce redesign can lessen this.</p>\r\n\r\n<h6>2. Your target audience is not relevant to your current design<h6> \r\n<p>When creating an e-commerce website, failing to take your target demographic into account can negatively affect users\' interactions with your system. Therefore, it is essential to conduct thorough market research and determine your target demographic.</p>\r\n \r\n \r\n<h6>3. Your website\'s user experience is unclear</h6>\r\n<p>You could wonder, \"What are the key indications of confusing UX?\" The list of its primary indicators is shown below.</p>\r\n<p>You should consider an e-commerce website makeover if your website fits two or more of these criteria.</p>\r\n<p><strong>It takes a while for the page to load or react.</strong></p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>The plugins\' integration is insufficient</li>\r\n<li>Unclear directions or several possibilities for direction</li>\r\n<li>The checkout\'s lengthy and difficult process (too many steps)</li> \r\n<li>There aren\'t enough spaces between chunks of information</li>\r\n<li>Not a \"search\" feature</li>\r\n<li>Too ornate typefaces</li>\r\n<li>The page\'s colors don\'t coordinate</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p><strong>You want to use a mobile-first strategy.</strong></p>\r\n<p>If your target market is between the ages of 25 and 30 years old, they are very likely to favor in-app purchases over online shopping. Going mobile-first when designing is an option in that situation. However, such a strategy necessitates a makeover of the e-commerce website.</p>\r\n \r\n<h6>5. Your market niche\'s trends change quickly.</h6>\r\n<p>In this era of instantaneous information, market trends are always shifting. But to succeed, it\'s imperative to stay current with trends in a variety of fields, including design. Older websites don\'t attract new visitors. When determining whether or not to go through the procedures of a website makeover, keep that in mind.</p>\r\n\r\n<h6>6. There is Severe Competition in the Market</h6>\r\n<p>If you notice that market norms have changed, the makeover of your web store is something to think about. New trends may emerge, putting your platform at risk of being obsolete.</p>\r\n \r\n<h6>7. You\'d Like To Grow Your Business </h6>\r\n<p>Increasing your customer base or entering new markets is often a prerequisite for scaling your firm. This increases the number of visitors to your website. You need to pay great attention to the design of your e-commerce platform to convert visitors into customers.</p>\r\n \r\n<h6>8. You want to alter your brand or marketing strategy</h6>\r\n<p>If you intend to rebrand your company, you must proceed with the makeover of your e-commerce platform. If you want your customers to recognize your brand and make repeat purchases, you need to target your market and be consistent.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Rebranding demanded a redesign of the webshop because your company\'s logo has undergone some alterations, your branding strategy has changed, and your platform\'s functionality has been altered.</p>\r\n\r\n<h6>9. New Capabilities</h6>\r\n<p>Your e-commerce platform becomes increasingly sophisticated as new features are added. As a result, it can stop being user-friendly. As a result, you must restructure your e-commerce platform to reduce the likelihood that you will lose potential customers.</p>\r\n \r\n<h6>10. Tech Stack Update </h6>\r\n<p>The adoption of new technologies necessitates a revised design, much like new functionality. If you don\'t update your design, users will be perplexed by the contradiction between current functionality and antiquated aesthetics.</p>\r\n \r\n<p>There are some trends in the latter, regardless of the reasons you choose to rebuild your webshop.</p>\r\n\r\n<h6>Online-commerce trends Revised website</h6>\r\n<p>The Top Design Firms report that 42% of visitors will leave a website if it is not working properly. Therefore, it is essential to maintain the functioning and look of your platform.\r\nWhat does it mean, though, when a website is popular? Together, let\'s examine a few e-commerce website design trends.</p>\r\n<h6>Enjoyable filtering capabilities</h6>\r\n \r\n<p>E-commerce struggles with filtering product searches. Where do shoes for men fit in? Do I go to the \"for guys\" section or the shoe department? Yes, designers do find rational categorization to be a challenging endeavor. A filter feature\'s extensive functionality results from its usefulness and efficiency. Having a fun design is merely an added benefit.</p>\r\n\r\n<h6>Neutral background colors</h6>\r\n<p>White backgrounds are viewed as being out of date for contemporary websites. Many e-commerce sites opt to change the background to be neutral in its place. Yes, neutral hues like green, sand, and grey rule the design industry.</p>\r\n \r\n<p>Why is that? Contrary to vibrant hues, they don\'t overpower your users and let them concentrate on the information on your platform. They seem clean and contemporary in contrast to white.</p>\r\n \r\n<h6>Layouts with multiple directions</h6>\r\n<p>Multiple-product galleries are frequently made by brands using grids that go left to right, diagonally, or even forward and backward. Users are free to move in whatever direction they like with this method of navigation.</p>\r\n \r\n<p>Furthermore, multidirectional grids frequently come with eye-catching animated transitions.</p>\r\n \r\n<h5>Where should the redesign process begin? What steps are included in a website redesign?</h5>\r\n\r\n<h6>Initial Usability Audit</h6>\r\n \r\n<p>Customers frequently find it difficult to comprehend the causes of low conversion, negative evaluations, and high churn rates. Professionals from DotOxygen conduct UI and UX usability audits to discover the issues. They are designed to locate interface bottlenecks. Then, our specialists offer advice on how to make the website simple to use.</p>\r\n \r\n<h6>Product Research</h6>\r\n \r\n<p>You must move on to the product discovery step once you are aware of the causes of your e-commerce platform\'s poor performance. At this point, DotOxygen specialists extensively investigate the market, analyze the competition, and analyze your target market./<p>\r\n\r\n<p>Additionally, it is essential to construct user stories and customer journey maps during this stage, as well as identify business, users, and discovery goals. All of these efforts aid in disseminating information about the product, the market it will serve, the intended market, etc.</p>\r\n \r\n<h6>Our customer E-Wish received product discovery assistance from the DotOxygen team.</h6>\r\n \r\n<p>The multifunctional marketplace known as E-Wish operates in the UK and offers a variety of services, including e-commerce, rental housing, and taxi services. With just a few clicks, consumers can use this platform to fulfill all of their demands.</p>\r\nOur professionals at this time were:\r\n<ul> \r\n<li>conducting stakeholder and user interviews</li>\r\n<li>defining business and user goals</li>\r\n<li>carrying out market research</li>\r\n<li>creating a monetization plan</li>\r\n<li>doing a category and subcategory search</li>\r\n<li>establishing personalities</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h6>New UX Design</h6>\r\n\r\n<p>Make sure your UX redesign\'s objectives are crystal clear before beginning this phase. It\'s time to start the e-commerce redesign once you have the essential data and have determined the adjustments that must be made. At this point, the main tasks DotOxygen can assist you with are:</p>\r\n \r\n<li>drawing your concepts </li>\r\n<li>constructing prototypes </li>\r\n<li>collecting user feedback</li>\r\n<li>deciding on a design</li>\r\n\r\n<p>We created a road map to begin the UX design process based on the application\'s concept and design. Wireframes and the information architecture were developed at this stage.</p>\r\n \r\n<h6>New UI Design</h6>\r\n\r\n<p>As soon as the UX redesign is complete and tested, you can move on to the UI redesign. The most important component of the UI redesign phase is consistency.

Don\'t attempt to redesign your platform entirely at once</h6>\r\n<p>Not everything needs to be fully redone. Most of the time, you simply need to modify the e-commerce platform\'s components that stand in the way of your planned outcomes.<p>\r\n\r\n<h6>2. Select a Reliable Vendor</h6>\r\n<p>The vendor you select to deal with will have a significant impact on the outcome of the website redesign process steps. As a result, you must take the hiring process carefully. You must thoroughly examine a partner\'s portfolio, client references, team performance overall, etc. before selecting one.<p>\r\n \r\n<h6>3. Understand everything. Why Do You Remodel?</h6>\r\n<p>Even if you follow the procedures for rebuilding a website, you won\'t get the rewards of doing so unless you have a clear knowledge of your motivations. Additionally, you need to comprehend the outcomes you hope to reach through a redesign.<p>\r\n\r\n<h6>4. Create a strong redesign strategy</h6>\r\n<p>The outcome can be tainted by choosing the incorrect strategy. The success of your product is built on planning. An e-commerce platform needs to be compatible with your company\'s business strategy to be profitable.<p>\r\n \r\n<p>All these best practices, though, won\'t help you enough if you don\'t develop user confidence in your product. How do you do it? Let\'s explore this together.<p>\r\n \r\n<h5>How Can You Increase Trust in Your Online Brand?</h5>\r\n<p>Instead of authority, individuals trust other people. Put this fact to good use. Furthermore, industry analysts contend that the first rule of conversion is user trust. Let\'s look at some strategies for enhancing consumer trust in your e-commerce brand.</p>\r\n\r\n<h6>1. Improve first impressions.</h6>\r\n<p>This idea focuses on having the best design and usability possible while also exhibiting your skills. Your online store\'s platform should be responsive and simple to use.<p>\r\n<p>You should also ask your customers to review your services, record testimonials, and consider where to arrange everything on your e-commerce platform to make a good first impression. This area needs to be simple to find while also being unbothersome.</p>\r\n \r\n<h6>2. Demonstrate Your Product</h6>\r\n<p>You must produce high-caliber graphics for your products to establish confidence. Without attractive images, you are unable to gain credibility and trust no matter what you sell. Customers who shop online are unable to physically inspect your merchandise.<p/>\r\n\r\n<h6>3. Be Reachable</h6>\r\n<p>The best approaches to establish trust through design are through usability and accessibility. Users have more confidence in platforms that are easy to use and offer clear information. Define issues that may be unclear to the general audience, reduce platform jargon, and make navigation clear.</p>\r\n \r\n<strong>How Can the E-Commerce Website Be Made Simpler to Use?</strong>\r\n \r\n<p>Here are some suggestions to help you create an accessible and simple-to-use e-commerce platform.</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Make a clear navigation plan</li>\r\n<li>Create clear navigation </li>\r\n<li>Create a basic feature </li>\r\n<li>Don\'t adorn your website with pointless elements </li>\r\n<li>Make sure the platform is responsive and high-performing </li>\r\n<li>Ensure a distinct separation between the general and the specialized</li>\r\n<li>Make use of current design fads</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h6>How Should I Create a Page Using the Product?</h6>\r\n<p>The fundamental design principle here is to provide all the information your user might need without overwhelming them. This work is easier to handle using photos and graphics.\r\nInclude a zoom option that will enable users to work on product descriptions, reviews, and other tasks while seeing the finer details of the goods they are interested in.</p>\r\n \r\n<h6>How Should a User Admin Page Be Made?</h6>\r\n \r\n<p>Your users\' bonuses, the history of their purchases, and suggestions for subsequent purchases should all be included on this page. But be careful not to add too many features. Ensure simplicity.<p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Don\'t adorn your website with pointless elements </li>\r\n<li>Make sure the platform is responsive and high-performing</li>\r\n<li>Ensure a distinct separation between the general and the specialized</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h6>How Much Does a Redesign of an E-Commerce Website Cost?</h6>\r\n \r\n<p>It is crucial to take into account several aspects that directly influence the cost of an e-commerce platform overhaul. For instance, they include the project\'s scope, or the number of pages and specifics, as well as the background and location of the contractor. Let\'s take a closer look at these elements.</p>\r\n \r\n<h5>The number of Pages and Details: Work Scope</h5>\r\n \r\n<p>In actuality, a variety of factors affect how long it takes to finish each level.<strong> Did you conduct the required research? Do you comprehend the outcomes you desire? What number of pages would you like to redesign?</strong></p>\r\n \r\n<p>Additionally, the time estimations vary depending on the size of your company. Yes, due to the numerous parties and all the permissions.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The workflow usually goes as follows:<p>\r\n \r\n<p><strong>discovering new products</strong></p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Businesses: 30 to 60 hours </li>\r\n<li>15–30 hours for a medium-sized job</li>\r\n<li>10-15 hours for quick projects</li>\r\n</ul> \r\n<h6>Design for UI/UX</h6>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li> 50–125 hours for businesses (UX), 100–200 hours (UI)</li>\r\n<li>Mid-sized project: 25–55 hours for UI and 30–50 hours for UX</li>\r\n<li>Smaller projects: 15 to 25 hours for UI and 15-20 hours for UX</li>\r\n<li>10 to 25 hours (for documentation), 125 to 250 hours (for the front end), and 150 to 300 hours (for the back end)</li>\r\n<li>Mid-sized projects: documentation (6–15 hours), front-end (60–100 hours), and back-end (65–105 hours)</li>\r\n<li>4-5 hours for documentation, 35–45 hours for the front end, and 40–50 hours for the back end of small projects</li>\r\n<li>Businesses: 40 hours</li>\r\n<li>20–40 hours for medium-sized tasks</li>\r\n<li>20 hours for small projects</li>\r\n</ul> \r\n<p>The experience and location of your possible partner are the next crucial factor you need to take into account.</p>\r\n \r\n<p>Experience and location of the contractor Eastern Europe, Western Europe, America, and Asia are the primary four continents that are home to skilled and experienced ICT professionals. Let\'s examine the estimated costs for various redesign stages in various locations.</p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"table table-striped\">\r\n<table>\r\n<thead>\r\n<tr>\r\n<th scope=\"col\"></th>\r\n<th scope=\"col\">Product Discovery</th>\r\n<th scope=\"col\">UI/UX Design</th>\r\n<th scope=\"col\">Development</th>\r\n<th scope=\"col\">QA</th>\r\n</tr>\r\n</thead>\r\n<tbody>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td>Eastern Europe</td>\r\n<td>$35-60/hr</td>\r\n<td>$35-60/hr</td>\r\n<td>$30-80/hr</td>\r\n<td>$25-50/hr</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td>Western Europe</td>\r\n<td>$45-90/hr</td>\r\n<td>$45-100/hr</td>\r\n<td>$55-100/hr</td>\r\n<td>$30-65/hr</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td>America</td>\r\n<td>$25-55/hr</td>\r\n<td><$45/hr</td>\r\n<td>$25-55/hr</td>\r\n<td>$20-40/hr</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td>Asia</td>\r\n<td>$15-25/hr</td>\r\n<td><$40/hr</td>\r\n<td><$45/hr</td>\r\n<td><$30/hr</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n</tbody>\r\n</table>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<p>Remember, though, that the price-quality ratio is far more crucial than the actual price.

(78, 4, 'DotOxygen', '30.08.2022', 'Fixed Cost vs. Time and Materials. What is the Difference', '<p>Which option should the business pick: fixed costs vs. time and materials? It might be challenging to collaborate with a group of engineers and designers, therefore it\'s critical to start by picking the best model. Focus on the model that will work best for both parties since each of the models has advantages and disadvantages.</p>\r\n \r\n<p>When carefully developing a new product, we always advise our clients to choose a cooperative model. We\'ve written blog that will help you decide by providing the answers to the following questions:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li> When is a fixed cost model necessary, and when is the T&M model preferable?</li>\r\n<li>How do these models differ from one another?</li>\r\n<li>Which businesses might benefit from this or that model?</li>\r\n<li>What sorts of services are this or that model appropriate for?</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h5>A fixed cost is what?</h5>\r\n<p>To complete the assignment, this type of collaboration necessitates paying a certain rate every hour. You need to have a project that is well-planned out and has a budget before you sign a contract.</p>\r\n \r\n<p>Remember that the project\'s objectives and requirements will dictate the task analysis and estimate. A technical task that the development team can evaluate is therefore essential.</p>\r\n<p>Here are some of the main benefits of the Fixed-Price approach that were emphasized in our comparison of Fixed Cost vs. Time and Materials:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Set project deadlines. The developers can simply determine a precise work plan and time estimate for the project if they are aware of all the pertinent details.\r\nConsequences that can be predicted and less danger. It is essential that all project phases, as well as the specifications of the technology and development control, are agreed upon before the contract is signed. You can cut costs on project control methods by doing this.\r\nA precise estimation of the amount that will be required for the development. The cost of technology, timing, and other project resources will be simpler to estimate if you have a clear understanding of the finished product.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Here are several drawbacks of the Fixed-Price model that were brought up in our analysis of Fixed Cost vs. Time and Materials:</p>\r\n \r\n \r\n<p>Changes are conceivable. Such circumstances may arise as a result of mistakes, flaws, or obsolescence, thus the business will need to set aside extra dollars for adjustments. Make sure the additional agreement indicates the potential of the amendment.</p>\r\n \r\n<p>There is a chance of misunderstandings. Misunderstandings between the client and the development team could happen at work. And if they are not fixed, the business will get a product that falls short of what it had hoped for.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Long-term planning is doable. Only until a precise technical task has been prepared, developed, evaluated, and both parties have agreed upon the first and second, is it possible to begin development.\r\nMarket shifts Never forget that the terms of reference were initially established depending on the status of the market. The program will need to be upgraded because the market scenario might not match expectations at the project\'s conclusion.</p>\r\n\r\n<h5>When Is a Fixed Cost Necessary?</h5>\r\n \r\n<p>This idea is suitable for companies with modest goals, constrained resources, and prospects. Furthermore, organizations in the public sector or those in need of an MVP should use the fixed-price model. Specifications should be provided for these projects. The needs of the project won\'t be satisfied in this case.</p>\r\n \r\n<h5>Time and Materials: What is it? (T&M)</h5>\r\n \r\n<p>Here are a few of the major advantages of the Time & Materials Model that was emphasized in our comparison of fixed costs vs time and materials.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Flexible conditions.</strong></p> \r\n<p>The team breaks down all of the work into stages, which you review and amend as needed.\r\nThe capacity to start working on a project right away. This model takes less time to prepare, making it ideal for businesses that value their time.\r\nHourly rate of pay You are charged for the time spent creating the product. The hourly rate is often negotiated and stated in the contract before it is signed. Only once the work is done are any payments made. Additionally, buyers occasionally pay a portion of the guarantee up front.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Software excellence. </strong></p> \r\n<p>The team will test the product at different phases and make adjustments to make it better. You will receive a superior product that lives up to your expectations as a consequence.</p>\r\n\r\n<h5>When is T&M the Ideal Choice?</h5>\r\n<p>The T&M paradigm works well for long-term projects or ones that call for frequent circumstances adjustments. This method is also fantastic for projects where the amount of work is not predetermined and when flexible development techniques are required.</p>\r\n \r\n \r\n<h5>What distinguishes fixed-price from time and material pricing?</h5>\r\n \r\n<p>The article\'s major argument is between fixed costs and time and materials. The fixed-price project vs the time and material difference can now be defined. Let\'s examine the key variations according to several factors:</p>\r\n \r\n<h6>Managing & Controlling</h6>\r\n \r\n<p>You can simply sit back and wait for the design and development team to complete the work for you once all the specifications have been agreed upon and the contract has been signed.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Given the distinction between the fixed-price and time-and-materials models, the fixed-price model does not necessitate the client\'s involvement and control at every stage of the procedure. While your project is being managed by professionals, you can concentrate on the problems facing your business or just go on holiday.</p>\r\n \r\n<p>The Time & Materials strategy is used by the client to manage the project budget. Additionally, this paradigm adds more control to the project. The client can modify the size and composition of the team, the work plan, the format, and the frequency of reporting based on the internal goals.</p>\r\n<p>Furthermore, the model\'s adaptability enables you to change both the team size and delivery schedules following the demands of the customer.</p>\r\n\r\n<h6>Billing and payments</h6>\r\n<p>The labor are compensated on an hourly basis under the time and materials strategy. Depending on labor costs, the client pays for the result. The job scope and project timeline estimates are only rough estimates. Adjustments are regularly made during T&M, and the outcome and quality—rather than the cost and terms—are what matter most.</p>\r\n \r\n<p>The T&M model\'s distinguishing characteristic is that payments are made taking into account labor costs and employee hourly rates. Budgeting for various stages is made simpler by the Time & Materials model\'s transparency of the job. Savings of between 10 and 30 percent of the budget are feasible with T&M.</p>\r\n<p>The main drawback of T&M is that it is uncertain how much time and money it would require.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Fixed-Price approach suggests that the timing and cost of the project are accurately established even before it begins. That functions as a sort of guarantee for the client that the job will be finished by the deadline and at the agreed-upon cost. The outsourcer agrees to renegotiate the budget with the client if it becomes apparent during work that more tasks must be resolved than anticipated.</p>\r\n \r\n<h6>Working Process</h6>\r\n \r\n<p>The customer is free to add or remove features and capabilities from the project at any time when working with an agency that implements the T&M model without entering into new contracts or agreements. All that needs to be kept in mind is that any new assignment requires the development team\'s time, which will need to be compensated.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>When working with T&M, the developers always keep the client up to date on the project\'s status. Regular customer meetings, presentations, and consistent time reporting in time trackers all help to ensure transparency.</p>\r\n \r\n \r\n<p>Customers that choose the fixed-price model typically develop extremely specific technical requirements. If doing so would interfere with the contractor\'s schedule for on-time delivery, the customer is not given the option to prioritize or exclude the completion of specific activities during the project.</p>\r\n \r\n<p>Additional agreements will be necessary for any changes to a project carried out under the Fixed-Price model.</p>\r\n \r\n<p>New information and feedback from participants and those who have the power to influence decisions are given less attention than the project documentation since the contract does not call for modifications in requirements after the start of development.</p>\r\n\r\n<h5>Fixed Cost vs. Time and Materials</h5>\r\n<div class=\"table table-striped\">\r\n<table>\r\n<thead>\r\n<tr>\r\n<th scope=\"col\">Fixed Cost</th>\r\n<th scope=\"col\">Time</th>\r\n<th scope=\"col\">Materials</th>\r\n</tr>\r\n</thead>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td>Startups</td>\r\n<td>+</td>\r\n<td>+</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td>SMBs</td>\r\n<td>+</td>\r\n<td>–</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td>Enterprise</td>\r\n<td>–</td>\r\n<td>+</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n</table>\r\n</div>\r\n<p>In our fixed-price project against time and material analysis, we can draw several conclusions. Working on projects with precise needs, a constrained budget, and deadlines is excellent under the fixed-price approach.</p>\r\n<ul> \r\n<li>company websites, landing pages, and one-page advertisements for minor products</li>\r\n<li>for a different block of work on the website, including redesigning particular pages, creating specific tools (like calculators), and automating particular business processes</li>\r\n<li>for MVP (minimum viable product), the initial iteration of the website with the bare minimum of features required to satisfy user demand</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>Additionally, the main distinction between time and material and set prices is that T&M is most appropriate for large projects. These projects need flexibility and lack detailed technical requirements and a functional needs list. For illustration:</p>\r\n<ul> \r\n<li>for goods that have a long list of functional needs that are updated frequently</li>\r\n<li>for solutions that automate and optimize business processes - personal accounts, internet portals</li>\r\n</ul> \r\n\r\n<p><strong>To Start-Ups</strong></p>\r\n \r\n<p>In our analysis of fixed-price projects vs time and material projects, startups have a significant role. Additionally, the Fixed-Price model is ideal. It may be utilized, for instance, if the project\'s concept is not quite apparent or the client has not yet agreed on the project\'s ultimate purpose.</p>\r\n \r\n<p><strong>To SMBs</strong></p>\r\n \r\n<p>In this fixed cost vs. time and materials comparison, we can\'t help but bring up small and medium firms. It is preferable in this circumstance to select a Fixed-Price model as well. Time & Materials is an option as well, although it depends on a variety of circumstances.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Time & Materials strategy should be used for Enterprise businesses. This technique works effectively because you have to create everything from scratch. After all, there aren\'t many pre-made options for enterprises of this size.</p>\r\n \r\n \r\n<h5>Time and Material vs. Fixed-Price Project [Types of Services]</h5>\r\n \r\n<p>One should compare the differences between both models for various service kinds as part of the Fixed-Price Project vs. Time and Material comparison. Let\'s examine each procedure in more detail.\r\n</p>\r\n \r\n<h6>Designing UX/UI (Redesign)</h6>\r\n \r\n<p>Both models are frequently candidates for a redesign. Everything should be based on your expectations and whether you are clear on what you hope to accomplish as a result. The scale of the project is also crucial when comparing fixed costs to the time and materials of the project.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Time and materials are the greatest options if the project is new. Use the Fixed-price approach if your project is just a typical business undertaking.</p>\r\n \r\n<h6>Develop Web Apps</h6>\r\n \r\n<p>When choosing a cooperation strategy for web app development, you should take the project\'s scope, financial constraints, and product vision into account. The Fixed-Price model is the greatest choice if we\'re talking about a company with a tight budget. But if we\'re talking about a startup with a sizable budget and a clear project strategy, choose Time and Materials./<p>\r\n\r\n<h6>Application Development</h6>\r\n<p>It is unnecessary to compare fixed cost vs. time and materials if you intend to develop sophisticated software and are unsure of what the final cost should be. Instead, adopt the times and materials approach.\r\n \r\nIf you are certain of the final piece of software you want and the characteristics it must have, the fixed-price approach is appropriate.</p>\r\n \r\n<h6>Development of MVP</h6>\r\n \r\n<p>The fixed-price approach is more suited for MVP development, as we have already stated. Companies planning to produce MVPs are only able to commit a limited amount of funding to the endeavor.</p>\r\n \r\n<h5>Work scope versus Fixed Cost vs. Time and Materials</h5>\r\n \r\n<p>Let\'s examine the variations among the models in light of the work scope in our</p>\r\n\r\n<h6>From nothing</h6>\r\n<p>If your project is brand new, you can use both models. Although each growth option necessitates rigorous process planning. The key step before selecting a model is to complete this.</p>\r\n \r\n<p>To start, you must determine your project\'s budget and the maximum amount you can spend. The next one is the ultimate objective, the future, and any potential enhancements. You should choose the fixed-price model if you can answer these questions for yourself. In that case, focus on the T&M model.</p>\r\n\r\n<h6>Enhance [Problem-Solving]</h6>\r\n<p>For this kind of task scope, the Time & Materials model is typically employed. If you need to make large-scale changes to your projects, such as developing distinct, sophisticated modules or new features, you can choose a fixed-price project as opposed to a time and material project.</p>\r\n\r\n<h5>Experience with DotOxygen</h5>\r\n\r\n<p>The DotOxygen team offers top-notch assistance with product development and design.

The project\'s timing, cost, and usefulness after completion all depend on selecting the best model of cooperation. Therefore, it is essential to dive into business processes, and research activities, and gather requirements before working with one of the models.</p>\r\n \r\n<p>Following that, it will be feasible to comprehend the differences between fixed-price and time and material contracts as well as which is preferable in each particular situation. </p>\r\n', '803707-fixed_cost_vs_time_and_materials_what_is_the_difference.jpg', 'Branding, Website Design, Website Development, User Interface, User Experience', '2022-08-30 14:18:14.47763', '30.08.2022'),
(86, 5, 'DotOxygen', '30.08.2022', 'Food Delivery App Development Process, Team, Mistakes and Cost', '<p>The value of the world food market is put at 83 billion euros. The sphere is expanding and getting stronger. Online food delivery is therefore becoming unavoidable. For instance, every fifth person in the UK made an online food order as of 2017.</p>\r\n \r\n<h4>Development of Food Delivery Apps:</h4>\r\n<p>Creating a meal delivery application is the focus of our most recent article. We\'ll examine the following issues today:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Who requires a meal delivery app?</li>\r\n<li>What are the most common applications for meal delivery?</li>\r\n<li>How can you make your concept for a meal delivery service better?</li>\r\n<li>What are the primary difficulties in developing meal delivery apps?</li>\r\n<li>What are the primary design issues with meal delivery apps?</li>\r\n<li>What constitutes a meal delivery application\'s fundamental components?</li>\r\n<li>What essential components should meal delivery apps have?</li>\r\n<li>What procedures must you follow to create a fantastic application for food delivery?</li>\r\n<li>What is the cost of developing a meal delivery app? How do you employ a crew to do that?</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>Let\'s begin with the initial query.</p>\r\n<h5>Who Needs to Develop Food Delivery Apps?</h5>\r\n<p>Let\'s start by talking about which businesses and organizations should consider creating a food delivery app. The two main business categories that we have identified are restaurants and startups.</p>\r\n<h6>Food businesses</h6>\r\n<p>Hora go data shows that, on average, online orders made using mobile food delivery applications increase a restaurant\'s income by 23% compared to standard orders. This metric can be made even better with the correct equipment. Not only did Covid 19 contribute to the restaurant industry\'s rapid digitalization, but this tendency also existed long before the epidemic and will last for at least the next six years.</p>\r\n<p>To reach a wider audience, restaurants are adopting food delivery apps. Many people wish to consume great meals but lack the time to go to restaurants, for instance. Apps that deliver food are the perfect solution for these people.</p>\r\n<p>Meal businesses also use food delivery services, for instance, to free up space in a restaurant during peak dining hours. People may now buy food to go even if there are no open seats in the restaurant thanks to the application. People won\'t go hungry in this scenario, and the restaurant will make more money.</p>\r\n<p>People who live more active lifestyles and have less time for social meetings in restaurants prefer food delivery. An excellent approach to making more money than you would in a restaurant is through a meal delivery app. The application can make you twice as much money, if not three times as much, while people are seated at one table for an extended period.</p>\r\n<p>A particularly practical product is the food delivery app. No longer are telephone orders or taxi services necessary. They may quickly get the dish they choose using the food delivery app. Such a tool is useful for announcing sales, exploring the menu, and promoting new products.</p>\r\n\r\n<h6>Startups</h6>\r\n<p>Regional aggregator firms also use the food delivery app, which allows users to select meals from a variety of restaurants. In this scenario, eateries and cafes without a delivery service join together with the aggregator to expand their sales through delivery.</p>\r\n \r\n<p>Applications can be used by entrepreneurs to transport food from different supermarkets or specialty shops. They assist consumers to save time and make it simpler for them to buy food thanks the application. Startups typically get a share of the money that businesses spend using the software.</p>\r\n\r\n<h6>Food delivery app types</h6>\r\n<p>Aggregators, logistics-focused, and full-cycle apps are the three primary categories of food delivery applications. Let\'s take a closer look at each type.</p>\r\n \r\n<h6>Aggregators</h6>\r\n \r\n<p>A food delivery aggregator is a smartphone application that serves as a marketplace for purchasing and simultaneously delivering food from a variety of restaurants. Among the benefits and drawbacks of food delivery aggregators is:</p>\r\n <ul>\r\n<li><p><strong>Facility promotion.<strong></p>\r\n</li><p>Aggregators are excellent platforms for restaurant marketing. Many people will discover your restaurant every day as they browse the restaurant directory.</p>\r\n<li><p><strong>Delegation of delivery. </strong></p></li>\r\n<p>Delivery services are offered by the aggregator to the restaurant, saving it the expense of managing delivery on its own.</p>\r\n<li><p><strong>The High Commissions. <strong></p></li>\r\n<p>As was already indicated, aggregators receive payments from eateries. Too many commissions could make it impossible.</p>\r\n<li><p><strong>Lack of command</strong></p></li>\r\n<p>By working with the aggregator, the restaurant forfeits control over a variety of factors, such as markups on menu items and the caliber of courier services. Additionally, errors on the part of the aggregator may harm users\' perceptions of the eatery.</p>\r\n<li><p><strong>Logistics-focused</strong></p></li>\r\n<p>First impressions suggest that aggregators and logistics-focused food delivery businesses have a lot in common. Through a single application, these systems enable customers to compare various cafés, prices, and cuisines as well as place an order.</p>\r\n </ul>\r\n<p>However, the firms expanding based on the \"new delivery\" model also offer logistics to the restaurants they partner with. It does away with the requirement that cafés hire their messengers. For firms that have never employed delivery services, it is very practical and useful.</p>\r\n \r\n<p>In contrast to aggregators, these services impose defined fees on both clients and the restaurants that have partnered with them.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Although customers frequently do not have to pay outrageous prices, these platforms do have a reasonable chance of turning a profit because of a steadily growing client and restaurant base.\r\n</p>\r\n \r\n<p>Analysts predict that by 2025, this industry will have handled $20 billion worth of orders.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<h6>Full-Cycle<h6>\r\n<p>Applications that include the entire food delivery cycle, such as restaurant management options and logistical considerations, are referred to as full-cycle food delivery applications. Applications for full-cycle food delivery provide the following benefits:</p>\r\n \r\n<p>Total command over all operations and the client experience. You always know what food is provided and when it is given; you are not dependent on outside logistics or other restaurant chefs.</p>\r\nEconomic Sustainability. \r\n<p>Yes, you may spend a lot of money, but you are not compelled to split your profits with partners or anybody else.</p>\r\nOutstanding Adaptability. \r\n<p>Due to your close relationship with your clients, you can pay attention to their needs and fulfill them without the involvement of businesses or independent contractors.</p>\r\n<h5>How To Make Your Food Delivery App Idea Better</h5>\r\n<p>Now let\'s examine how to make your proposed meal delivery app idea better. Our team\'s expertise is the basis of all the information we share.</p>\r\n \r\n<h6>Examine market developments and potential</h6>\r\n<p>Research the market, its trends, and its potential first. You should be aware of the current trends among regular users of meal delivery apps. Discover the procedures utilized to create food delivery apps. Examine what current technology, features, and designs are frequently created for applications involving food delivery.</p>\r\n\r\n<h6>Investigate opposition</h6>\r\n<p>The second thing you must do is research and assess your rivals. Investigate their apps, evaluate them, list the features you like and dislike, consider what you would modify or enhance, etc. In a table of comparative competitors, you can also record all the information you will need in the future.</p>\r\n \r\n<h6>With MVP, test the concept.</h6>\r\n<p>Third, use an MVP to test your idea. A product with the bare minimum of functionality is called an MVP. However, you must include the most essential features. A fantastic technique to determine whether your product is needed in the market and whether you are heading in the correct direction is to use an MVP.</p>\r\n\r\n<h6>Challenges in Developing Food Delivery Apps</h6>\r\n<p>Let\'s now examine the difficulties you can run into when creating a food delivery application.</p>\r\n \r\n<h6>The appropriate technology stack</h6>\r\n<p>Choosing the appropriate technological stack is one of the difficulties in establishing a meal delivery application. Many development teams or individuals lack the knowledge necessary to choose the proper stack while building a food delivery application.</p>\r\n \r\n<p>At the beginning of the product development process, it is crucial to choose a qualified and experienced team that develops products and solutions using cutting-edge technology and best practices.</p>\r\n\r\n<h6>Data protection</h6>\r\n<p>A food delivery service should be safeguarded from data loss and cyberattacks, just like any other application.In any event, when registering in the application, customers must input their personal information and credit card details. Therefore, it\'s important to safeguard your users against potential system intrusions and data theft.</p>\r\n \r\n<h6>Compatibility with payment systems</h6>\r\n<p>Users of your app ought to be able to pay for their purchases right away without exiting the program. Allow users to connect their bank cards, as well as to utilize PayPal, for example, to make payments. Apple Pay and Google Pay are additional options for fast payment.</p>\r\n\r\n<h6>API for navigation</h6>\r\n<p>This item is in charge of making sure that the application accurately and automatically determines where it is located, such as the courier\'s location or the location where the courier should pick up the order. This is a necessary and important component of a food delivery application.</p>\r\n\r\n<h5>Developing a Food Delivery App: Challenges</h5>\r\n<p>Let\'s now look at the difficulties you can encounter during the design stage.</p>\r\n \r\n<h6>Usability of a product</h6>\r\n<p>The application\'s convenience and usability are due to usability. The following 5 factors make up usability:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li><strong>Simplicity</strong></li> \r\n<p>The application is simple for new users to use: there is no need to deal with the design, spend time learning the functionalities, or enable pop-ups.</p>\r\n<li><strong>Efficiency.</strong></li> \r\n<p>The user may complete the desired action fast, such as reading the menu, placing an order, or contacting the business.</p>\r\n<li><strong>Memorability. </strong></li> \r\n<p>Even if the user hasn\'t used the application in a while, he can still effortlessly navigate the layout.</p>\r\n<li><strong>Satisfaction. </strong></li> \r\n<p>Users enjoy the content, navigation, and design. They voluntarily carry out commands. </p>\r\n<li><strong>Readability</strong></li> \r\n<p>It refers to how easily users can understand the information and content of the program. Numerous elements, such as typography, fonts, illustration layout, text block size, text color, etc, have an impact on readability. Users\' perceptions of the data and goods displayed in the application are also influenced by readability.</p>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>An app for food delivery should be as simple to use as feasible. Expect failure if, for instance, people do not comprehend what has to be done for them to place an order in a matter of seconds.</p>\r\n\r\n<h6>Addressing each target user\'s needs</h6>\r\n<p>The application for food delivery will be utilized by regular people, couriers, and restaurants. Therefore, it is crucial to consider the wants and needs of each of these groups. The design of an application should have functional differences even though it can have the same aesthetic for all user groups.</p>\r\n\r\n<h6>Establishing a brand</h6>\r\n<p>Your brand should be represented in the app\'s design. Your app must be easily recognizable and distinct from those of your rivals. Add branded components such as a logo, colors, and more to the app design.</p>\r\n \r\n<h5>Align with the marketing approach</h6>\r\n<p>Do not forget that you will need to advertise and promote the application when it has been released. As a result, your design and marketing strategies should coordinate.</p>\r\n \r\n<h6>Core Components of Food Delivery App Development</h6>\r\n<p>The process of developing a food delivery app involves making apps for three key personas: the user, the courier, and the restaurant. Take a closer look at each of these characters individually.</p>\r\n\r\n<h6>User interface</h6>\r\n<p>Remember that your application will essentially require the submission of three separate applications. The user\'s application comes first. For regular people who want to place an order at a restaurant or other eating business, all pertinent information should be available.</p>\r\n \r\n<p>The user should be able to place orders, pay for them, track their delivery, look at the menu, pick a restaurant, etc. Later on, we\'ll go into greater detail regarding the features.</p>\r\n \r\n<h6>Application for a courier</h6>\r\n \r\n<p>Relevant information for the courier should be included in the courier application. For instance, it could include details about the order that a specific courier is supposed to deliver, the delivery address, the cost of the order, the route, etc.</p>\r\n\r\n<h6>Restaurant software</h6>\r\n<p>The ability to post an up-to-date menu, the number of online orders, a list of free couriers, and other information should be included in a restaurant application. The restaurant application has to be more thorough and incorporate all the details regarding both customers and couriers.</p>\r\n\r\n<h6>Must-Have Features for Food Delivery Apps in 2022</h6>\r\n<p>Let\'s now examine the list of qualities that every meal delivery app must have. If you want your application to be competitive and in demand in 2022, you should incorporate these characteristics.</p>\r\n \r\n<h6>Individual account</h6>\r\n<p>Users are the ones that need personal accounts the most. Users will enter personal data into their accounts, such as their bank card number, delivery address, email address for promotional emails, etc.</p>\r\n \r\n<h6>Internet payment</h6>\r\n<p>Provide an online payment option for customers to pay for their orders. The majority of individuals favor utilizing this specific payment option over using cash.</p>\r\n\r\n<h6>Talk to a courier</h6>\r\n<p>Include a chat function with the courier so that customers may manage the delivery of their order. The courier will be able to write to the chat and find your whereabouts, for instance, if he gets lost. Using this chat, you can get any queries about your order answered.</p>\r\n \r\n<h6>Rating</h6>\r\n<p>All people, in general, require this functionality. For instance, the restaurant rating will inform users of the establishment\'s success and level of service. Users can view the courier rating to see, for instance, how promptly and effectively the courier delivers their item.</p>\r\n \r\n<h6>Coupon codes</h6>\r\n<p>Users can take advantage of special discounts on orders at particular restaurants by using promotional coupons.</p>\r\n\r\n<h6>Live to monitor</h6>\r\n<p>Users will be able to track their order\'s delivery, the location of the courier, and the estimated arrival time thanks to this functionality.</p>\r\n \r\n<h6>Order standing</h6>\r\n<p>Users will be able to see the status of their order using this feature at a specific time. In other words, assume the order will have the following statuses: accepted, processed, in process, and delivered.</p>\r\n \r\n<h6>Chat for support</h6>\r\n<p>Users must have access to this chat to rapidly resolve any issues that may emerge. The customer can ask any questions and receive assistance through the support chat.</p>\r\n\r\n<h6>Checkout</h6>\r\n<p>Users must have access to this functionality to finish the food ordering procedure. To verify all the information entered and send the order for processing, you must checkout.</p>\r\n \r\n<h6>History of orders</h6>\r\n \r\n<p>Users can view their order history to see exactly which foods and from which restaurants they have previously ordered. Users will be able to keep track of, for instance, how much they paid for online meal delivery and how many bonuses they obtained thanks to this tool (in case the restaurants where orders were made offer a bonus system).</p>\r\n \r\n<h6>Rations compilation</h6>\r\n \r\nPeople who adhere to particular diets can generate rations for a defined amount of time and arrange for daily or weekly delivery with the aid of the compilation of rations.</p>\r\n\r\n<h6>Cashback</h6>\r\n<p>Users will be able to obtain a set amount of cashback after placing an order thanks to the cashback feature. The cashback percentages may vary between restaurants.</p>\r\n \r\n \r\n<h6>Counting calories</h6>\r\n \r\n<p>A calorie counter that determines how many calories are in each dish can be added to the app. Vegetarians and anyone who follows particular diets will appreciate this option.</p>\r\n \r\n<h6>Notifications</h6>\r\n \r\n<p>Updates that happen in restaurants or promotions, for instance, should be made known to users. Users will be able to constantly be informed of new events and updates thanks to the notification system.</p>\r\n \r\n<h6>Discounts</h6>\r\n \r\n<p>With the help of this function, businesses will be able to announce discounts for regular customers or particular seasonal menu items, for instance. Restaurants make their own decisions regarding discounts.</p>\r\n\r\n<h5>Development of a Food Delivery App: A Step-by-Step Guide</h5>\r\n<h6>Point 1: Create an Idea and Describe It First</h6>\r\n<p>You must outline your potential product. Describe the appearance, features, and functionality that you want your product to have, as well as the specifics of how it should operate. Every successful product has an initial concept. And the better is to describe it in more detail. You\'ll find it simpler to formulate a strategy and explain to your team what they need to do so.</p>\r\n\r\n<h6>Point 2: Product research and marketing analysis</h6>\r\n<p>Do some market research next. Research the market, your rivals, and your intended audience. Discover new products. Establish whether users will use your product, whether they will pay for it, and whether your application is necessary to tackle any particular problems. You can go on to the design stage after conducting the study and receiving the findings.</p>\r\n\r\n<h6>Point 3: User Experience Design: Logic and Navigation</h6>\r\n<p>You need to create a prototype, logic, and navigation for the product at this point. A prototype is an application\'s thorough blueprint. Before beginning graphic design, it is important to concentrate on the meaning and conceptualize the interface. A well-designed prototype serves as a complete application framework that can subsequently be easily \"put on\" to implement the concept.</p>\r\n \r\n<p>Remember navigation and logic when prototyping. The user will probably cease using your product if the navigation is difficult or the application\'s chain of events is illogical.</p>\r\n<h6>Point 4: Testing</h6>\r\n<p>You must test the UX design once it is complete. You should specifically test each action that will be taken in the application, its consistency, and the navigation. The better results come from extended testing. You will have the opportunity to fix any potential problems while testing. It is preferable to implement it now rather than when customers are actively using your product later.</p>\r\n\r\n<h6>Point 5: User Interface Design: Design Elements</h6>\r\n<p>Building interfaces with an emphasis on interactivity and aesthetics is what user interface (UI) design is all about. The goal of the UI designer is to create an interface that is both simple to use and aesthetically pleasing.</p>\r\n<p>UI design refers to the aesthetic selections a designer makes when producing a product, such as an image, button, menu bar, or footer. The user\'s engagement will be impacted by each of these aspects. They should therefore be carefully considered.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Start the Food Delivery App Development Life Cycle with point six.\r\nThe design must now be transformed into a usable product. The entire life cycle of developing a meal delivery app was broken down into multiple parts. Let\'s examine each of them more closely.</p>\r\n \r\n<h6>Point 7.1: Technical documentation for the product</h6>\r\n<p>To create a product that meets the expectations and requirements of the customer, all pertinent information from the client is gathered during this phase. The group should select technical stacks and develop technical documentation.</p>\r\n \r\n<p>The team should also establish the functionality needs (requirements for the admin panel) and user roles at this time (admin and super admin). The estimate and scope of work should be finished by the team.</p>\r\n\r\n<h6>Point 7.2: The development of food delivery apps</h6>\r\n<p>When building code for each component of an application, mobile app developers refer to the architecture and documentation from earlier processes.</p>\r\n \r\n<h6>Point 7.3: QA </h6>\r\n<p>QA engineers run manual tests on produced components and test all provided code.</p>\r\n \r\n<h6>Point 7.4: Integration & Deployment</h6>\r\n<p>The team proceeded to production deployment and integration once the QA team completed its development and regression testing. Users are given access to the product\'s tested version so they can do beta testing. The group gathers user input while also implementing some changes and issue fixes.</p>\r\n\r\n<h6> Point 7.5: Maintenance </h6>\r\n<p>The development team is in charge of a product\'s maintenance after it is put into use in a production setting, or if any problems arise that need to be rectified or enhancements that need to be made.</p>\r\n \r\n<h6>Point 8: Collect and evaluate user comments</h6>\r\n \r\n<p>Next, gather customer reviews of your meal delivery service. The following questions can be answered by completing a survey:</p>\r\n <ul>\r\n<li>Is it easy to utilize your app for food delivery? </li>\r\n<li>Do people ever experience any issues with the product?</li>\r\n<li>How well does the meal delivery app meet consumers\' needs?</li>\r\n<li>What about the product would people wish to see improved?</li>\r\n<li>How well does the product live up to consumer expectations?</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>Answers to these questions will help you understand </p>\r\n\r\n<h6>Point 9: Enhance and Expand</h6>\r\n<p>The development of the meal delivery software doesn\'t stop there. You should keep developing and improving your product after evaluating user feedback. The crucial thing to keep in mind is that success depends on development.</p>\r\n \r\n<h5>How Do I Hire a Development Team for a Food Delivery App?</h5>\r\n \r\n<p>Many businesses frequently worry about how to assemble a strong workforce for their undertaking. To assist you in selecting the best developer for a food delivery app, we have put up a mini-guide. Let\'s examine each action separately:</p>\r\n\r\n<h6> Outline your requirements, budget, and goals.</h6>\r\n<p>Establish your objectives, spending limit, and specifications before you begin looking for a team for your project (for both the team and the product). You need to be extremely clear about your ultimate objective as well as how much money you are willing to spend on developing meal delivery software.</p>\r\n \r\n<p>You should also decide on the fundamental needs for your future team (what experience it should have, what skills and knowledge it should have, etc.) You should also decide what specifications your future product will need.<p>\r\n\r\n<h6>2. Select a Cooperation Model</h6>\r\n<p>You should consider the opportunities that each sort of contract offers up when selecting a cooperation model for a team. Time & Materials and Fixed Price contracts are currently the most widely used payment models.<p>\r\n \r\n<p>Key advantages of using fixed prices:<p>\r\n <ul>\r\n<li>a set budget</li>\r\n    <li>a set quantity of labor</li>\r\n        <li>definite temporal limits</li>\r\n            <li>incapacity to add or amend terms of the contract after it has been signed</li>\r\n                <li>greater rates of development</li>\r\n                    <li>concessions that could be made in terms of the product\'s quality</li>\r\n </ul>\r\n<h6>The Time&Materials model has these advantages:</h6>\r\n<p>It is a flexible payment scheme that complies with Agile concepts completely\r\nthe possibility to swiftly begin development - in contrast to Fixed Price, working together on T&M allows you to begin right away<p>\r\n    <p>Transparent hourly prices for developers give the client control over assignments, budget, and deadlines<p>\r\n        <p>The capacity to observe work results at each stage<p>\r\n            <p>You receive a resolution that lives up to your demands.<p>\r\n\r\n<h6>3. Locate and speak with possible teams</h6>\r\n<p>The next step is to begin assembling a team for your project. On social media platforms like Linkedin, review websites, freelance websites, or by asking your friends, you can locate a good team.</p>\r\n \r\n<p>You can start doing interviews once you\'ve chosen a few potential hires. However, make a list of questions in advance of the interview. You can use the following questions from our list in the interview:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n    <li>What is your background? How long have you been employed in this field?</li>\r\n        <li>What tasks have you completed? Where did these projects originate?</li>\r\n            <li>What challenges did you encounter when developing the product, and how did you overcome them?</li>\r\n                <li>How did the projects you worked on turn out?</li>\r\n                    <li>Have you ever had a project go bad? What factors led to the failure?</li>\r\n                        <li>What do you consider to be your most successful project?</li>\r\n                            <li>Is there effective communication among the team members?</li>\r\n                                <li>How soon do you address issues that come up while developing a product?</li>\r\n                                    <li>Which tech stacks do you employ at work the most?</li>\r\n                                        <li>Do you adhere to trends and best practices when creating new products?</li>\r\n                                            <li>What sets you apart from other teams?</li>\r\n                                                <li>What is the secret to the success of your team?</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h6>4. Create a development team for your food delivery app.</h6>\r\n<p>You can begin working together after selecting the team that best meets your needs. Never overlook signing a contract to keep things on an official level. Discuss frequent meetings and workshops with the group. Talk about each employee\'s tasks and work schedule.</p>\r\n \r\n<p>Read our post How to Hire a Dedicated Software Development Team? to learn more about dedicated teams.</p>\r\n \r\n<h6>5. Establish KPI</h6>\r\n<p>The creation of KPIs is a crucial step. You may assess a worker\'s performance using key performance indicators to see how quickly, effectively, and well they are working. These factors determine whether the team will meet the objectives the organization has set for them.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The right KPIs must be selected and calculated to accurately evaluate the performance of a specific team member.</p>\r\n \r\n<p>Members of a focused software development team benefit greatly from the capabilities of the KPI tool because you do not need to observe the managers\' hourly work. To control the KPI, it is sufficient to calculate it at the beginning and end of each month.</p>\r\n\r\nCost of developing a food delivery app\r\n<p>The cost of developing a meal delivery app can be approximated based on the project\'s scope, development strategy, technology stack, and team size.

Every day, business owners of both large and small organizations type this query into the Google search field in the hopes of receiving a precise and pertinent response. Today, we\'ll attempt to do it.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>One of the most important elements affecting a company\'s decision to develop a new product is the cost of product design. You must research the market and weigh your options if you want to produce a product successfully and without wasting a lot of money.</p>\r\n \r\n<p>Let\'s first have a look at what the cost of product design entails to determine how much it costs to produce a product.</p>\r\n \r\n<h5>Cost of Product Design: What is covered by the price?</h5>\r\n \r\n<p>Costs for product design comprise four crucial components. Let\'s examine them in greater detail.<p>\r\n\r\n<h6>Product Research</h6>\r\n<p>Multiple closely connected sub-processes make up the Product Discovery business process. Finding product/market fit and validating the business model with a functioning product are the objectives of this stage.</p>\r\n \r\n<p>Continually lowering risks through the validation of customer behavior, value proposition, product solution, business strategy, and acquisition channels is the key to achieving this. The secret to developing a product that will find a market is product discovery.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>You ought to receive concise responses to the following questions during this process:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Is it worthwhile to solve this issue?</li>\r\n<li>How is the product made to function?</li>\r\n<li>How can I get folks to pay for this thing? What kind of functionality, style, attributes, etc.</li>\r\n<li>How can the product be adequately monetized?</li>\r\n<li>What is essential and what is not for the MVP?</li>\r\n<li>How were ideas put into practice before you? </li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>Even if you are certain that your product will satisfy a certain consumer requirement, product discovery will help you design it properly before you begin developing an MVP.</p>\r\n \r\n<p>Product discovery aids businesses in making the best selections possible. Although product discovery will assist you in persuading people that your product is a wonderful concept.\r\nUX Design UX design is in charge of how well users interact with a website\'s or application\'s interface. UX design is more than just pretty pictures. It mainly focuses on a simple user experience.</p>\r\n \r\n<p>UX design is constantly taking place. Whether on purpose or accidentally, someone decides how the user will engage with the product. When we create choices that satisfy the needs of both our customers and our company, we are practicing good user experience design.</p>\r\n \r\n<p>At DotOxygen, we deal with UX design using a variety of approaches, such as UX Lab, eye-tracking, and Between Subjects Design.</p>\r\n<p>The cost of premium UX design is high. Although it is a difficult and time-consuming procedure, it is essential to the success of your product. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>UI Design User interface design, often known as UI design, is the process of creating the buttons, input fields, and application forms that users interact with when using a product. UI is a tool if UX is a process. However, they all strive to make the product\'s user experience pleasant, pleasurable, and memorable.</p>\r\n \r\n<p>This procedure merits financial support. 94 percent of users, according to mythology, don\'t trust items with terrible design.</p>\r\n \r\n<h6>Usability Evaluation</h6>\r\n \r\n<p>Usability testing is a testing technique used to determine how usable, learnable, comprehensible, and appealing the generated product is to users in the context of predetermined terms.</p>\r\n<h6>Why is this step so crucial, and why is funding sufficient to complete it required?</h6>\r\n\r\n<p>Usability testing determines how usable a product is based on the following criteria:</p>\r\n <ul>\r\n<li><strong>Efficiency</strong></li>\r\n<p>How long would it take the user to finish the fundamental duties of the product, like sending a newsletter, signing up, buying, etc</p>\r\n \r\n<li><strong>Accuracy</strong></li>\r\n<p>How many errors did the customer make using the product.</p>\r\n \r\n<li><strong>Recall</strong></li>\r\n <p>How much of the product\'s work does the user still recall after having been away from it for a while.</p>\r\n \r\n<li><strong>Emotional reaction </strong></li>\r\n<p>How do consumers feel when a task is finished? Are they ecstatic or perplexed? Will customers tell their friends about the product?</p>\r\n\r\n<h5>What is the price of product design?</h5>\r\n \r\n<p>What is the price of developing a new product? The steps of product design that are covered by pricing have already been covered. Now let\'s examine average prices by seniority and nation.</p>\r\n \r\n<p>You would think that since product design is a crucial step in the creation of a product, any company would have a staff of designers. All year round, many major companies do employ product designers. Others, on the other hand, would rather hire a group of independent designers or web design firms to complete the task.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Cost savings are also to blame for that. Companies don\'t always need product designers. Designers may not be required for several months after a product has been developed. Designers should not be paid a salary year-round if they are not performing the task.</p>\r\n \r\n<p>Even if freelancers or agencies charge extra for services, there are still some sizable discounts overall. Later, we\'ll discuss if working with an agency or a freelancer is preferable for your project.</p>\r\n \r\n<h5>Let\'s talk about product design costs by seniority and nation.</h5>\r\n\r\n<h6>Average costs by nation</h6>\r\n<p>It is crucial to select a design team from a nation where the price is in line with the quality if you want the design to be affordable. According to some research, a company can save product design costs by up to 60% by employing outside design teams without sacrificing quality.</p>\r\n \r\nLet\'s calculate the cost of hiring a product designer from various regions of the world. We have produced brief price lists for product designs for your convenience.</p>\r\n\r\n<h6>The price of product design in Eastern Europe</h6>\r\nIn Central and Eastern Europe, the IT outsourcing market is growing at a rate that is 4-5 times faster than the global average: 20-25 percent per year vs. 5 percent per year.</p>\r\n \r\nThe price of outsourcing product design in Eastern Europe varies per nation. For instance, engaging specialists in Poland or the Czech Republic will cost more than hiring designers in Ukraine.</p>\r\n \r\n<p>The hourly rate for a junior product designer is about $25, whereas the rate for a senior product designer is about $50. Let\'s examine a price list for product design in Eastern Europe:</p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"table table-striped\">\r\n<table>\r\n<thead>\r\n<tr>\r\n<th scope=\"col\">Product discovery</th>\r\n<th scope=\"col\">UX design</th>\r\n<th scope=\"col\">UI design</th>\r\n<th scope=\"col\">Usability testing</th>\r\n<th scope=\"col\"></th>\r\n</tr>\r\n</thead>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td>Price per hour</td>\r\n<td>$35-65/hr</td>\r\n<td>$35-60/hr</td>\r\n<td>$25-55/hr</td>\r\n<td>$20-50/hr</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n</table>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<h6>Cost of product design in Asia</h6>\r\n<p>How much does it cost to employ an Asian product designer? We\'ll see. Asian nations are among the top outsourcing destinations in the world, and their designers are renowned for creating inexpensive but subpar goods.</p>\r\n \r\n<p>If you\'re looking for a product design partner in Asia, the most well-known Asian tech hubs charge rookie designers $10 to $15 per hour and senior designers $20 to $30 per hour.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As was previously mentioned, lower-quality projects are sacrificed to achieve price reductions and quick design turnaround times. Communication between the committed employees and the client suffers as a result of cultural barriers, uncomfortable working conditions, and time zone disparities.

It will cost you about $30 per hour to hire a junior product designer from a Latin American nation like Brazil, Argentina, or Mexico. Senior product designers, in contrast, will run you about $50 per hour.</p>\r\n \r\n<p>You could also find cheaper rates in this region, like $7 to $15 per hour, but bear in mind that the quality of the outcomes isn\'t usually very high.

The hourly wage for product design will increase with experience in the field.</p>\r\n \r\n \r\n<p>Junior specialists are typically new designers who might not have the experience and abilities to work on huge and difficult projects. Junior designers typically work on modest projects with a condensed list of specifications and duties.</p>\r\n<p>Senior and middle experts have a greater depth of training, expertise, and understanding. These designers typically have hundreds of projects under their belts and are prepared to present their portfolios.</p>\r\n<div class=\"table table-striped\">\r\n<table>\r\n<thead>\r\n<tr>\r\n<th scope=\"col\">Product discovery</th>\r\n<th scope=\"col\">UX design</th>\r\n<th scope=\"col\">UI design</th>\r\n<th scope=\"col\">Usability testing</th><th scope=\"col\"></th>\r\n</tr>\r\n</thead>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td>Junior</td>\r\n<td>$15-25/hr</td>\r\n<td>$15-25/hr</td>\r\n<td><$20/hr</td>\r\n<td>$10-15/hr</td>\r\n</tr><tr>\r\n<td>Middle</td>\r\n<td>$25-35/hr</td>\r\n<td>$30-45/hr</td>\r\n<td>$25-40/hr</td>\r\n<td>$20-35/hr</td>\r\n</tr><tr>\r\n<td>Senior</td>\r\n<td>$35-70/hr</td>\r\n<td>$50-100/hr</td>\r\n<td>$45-80/hr</td>\r\n<td>$30-60/hr</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n</table>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<h6>Timeline for product design is typical. Why is it so crucial?</h6>\r\n<p>It takes time to create a new product, especially if you want to have a fantastic design. The size of your business, the complexity of your product, the number of parts it comprises, and the effectiveness of the design team you select will all affect how much time you\'ll need.</p>\r\n \r\n<p>The price of product design directly relates to how long it takes to design the product. Knowing the typical timeframe for product creation is crucial. Let\'s examine how long various design stages typically take for businesses of various sizes.</p>\r\n\r\n<h6>Small businesses and startups</h6>\r\n<p>It makes logical to presume that product design will take some time for small businesses and startup initiatives. The intricacy of your project, your requirements, and other factors still have a role. Later, we\'ll discuss the variables that impact time and product design costs. Let\'s examine how much time your small business or startup needs for each stage of the product design process:</p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"table table-striped\">\r\n<table>\r\n<thead>\r\n<tr>\r\n<th scope=\"col\">Product discovery</th>\r\n<th scope=\"col\">UX design</th>\r\n<th scope=\"col\">UI design</th>\r\n<th scope=\"col\">Usability testing</th>\r\n</tr>\r\n</thead>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td>30-60 hours</td>\r\n<td>60-90 hours</td>\r\n<td>50-100 hours</td>\r\n<td>40 hours</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n</table>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<h6>Middle-sized</h6>\r\n<p>Mid-sized businesses typically already have a list of fundamental design needs as well as a clearly defined product idea. In this instance, the company\'s hiring of the team has an impact on the schedule for product design. You need to hire pros if you want a high-quality product in a short period.</p>\r\n<p>Let\'s examine the time requirements for the various phases of the product design process for your middle-sized business:</p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"table table-striped\">\r\n<table>\r\n<thead>\r\n<tr>\r\n<th scope=\"col\">Product discovery</th>\r\n<th scope=\"col\">UX design</th>\r\n<th scope=\"col\">UI design</th>\r\n<th scope=\"col\">Usability testing</th>\r\n</tr>\r\n</thead>\r\n<tr><td>60-120 hours.</td>\r\n<td>120-200 hours</td>\r\n<td>110-220 hours</td>\r\n<td>40-80 hours</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n</table>\r\n</div>\r\n<h6>Business size</h6>\r\n<p>Huge, sophisticated products with numerous needs are typically developed by large companies. Typically, these businesses seek a distinctive design that will set them apart from rivals and win over a large user base.</p>\r\n \r\n<p>As a result, the design team working on a project for an enterprise-level organization will need a lot of time to research a niche, carry out business analysis, generate wireframes, carry out testing, etc. The following table illustrates how much time businesses require for various phases of the product design process:</p>\r\n<div class=\"table table-striped\">\r\n<table>\r\n<thead>\r\n<tr>\r\n<th scope=\"col\">Product discovery</th>\r\n<th scope=\"col\">UX design</th>\r\n<th scope=\"col\">UI design</th>\r\n<th scope=\"col\">Usability testing</th>\r\n</tr>\r\n</thead>\r\n<tr><td>120-240 hours</td>\r\n<td>200-500 hours</td>\r\n<td>400-600 hours</td>\r\n<td>80 hours</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n</table>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<h6>What Is The Price Of Developing A New Product?</h6>\r\n<p>We already discussed the typical costs for various product design phases and the time needed for each of these stages.</p>\r\n<p>You must use a straightforward formula to determine how much your project\'s design will cost you: multiply the cost by the amount of time. Here are the approximate project expenses for enterprises of various sizes, based on prices in Eastern Europe:</p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"table table-striped\">\r\n<table>\r\n<thead>\r\n<tr>\r\n<th scope=\"col\">Startups</th>\r\n<th scope=\"col\">Middle-size</th>\r\n<th scope=\"col\">Enterprise size</th>\r\n</tr>\r\n</thead>\r\n<tr><td>$15,000-50,000</td>\r\n<td>$35,000-70,000</td>\r\n<td>$70,000-150,000</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n</table>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<h6>Costs Of Product Design: Important Elements That Impact Price</h6>\r\n \r\n<p>The cost of product design is affected by numerous factors. Some of them have already been mentioned. Let\'s now focus on the most fundamental one.</p>\r\n \r\n<h6>Project\'s size</h6>\r\n \r\n<p>The cost of product design is significantly influenced by the project size. That is typically how many screens, pages, or modules the product has to offer. Small products typically have 20 or fewer displays, medium products have 21 to 40 screens, while large products have more than 40 screens.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The processes involved in optimizing and testing a product with around 40 screens and numerous complicated features take more time and work than those involved in a smaller project. Therefore, the hourly rate for product design will increase if you desire your product to include more displays or modules.</p>\r\n \r\n<h6>The project\'s complexity</h6>\r\n<p>One of the key factors affecting the cost of product design is complexity. That is referring to how intricate the product logic is. Moreover, when a product requires customized typefaces, symbols, graphics, etc., the complexity can also be found in the design itself.</p>\r\n \r\n<p>Don\'t lose out on design changes, though, as UX and UI have a direct impact on how usable your product is.</p>\r\n\r\n<h6>Technical aspects</h6>\r\n<p>The price of product design relies on how many features you want to include in your product. You will need to spend more if you want to aby complicated features.</p>\r\n \r\n<p>This element and the project\'s complexity are strongly related. You will require a group of experts who have a tonne of experience designing a variety of features.</p>\r\n<p>Businesses that want to provide their customers with advanced chances should be aware that doing so will require additional funding. To enhance the company\'s brand identification, customer loyalty, and other factors, further features are needed. If you want a typical product with a basic feature set, the product design cost will be less.</p>\r\n\r\n<h6>Functionality</h6>\r\n<p>The functionality of the item is its main selling point. Functionality is the totality of what your product is capable of. Functionality must be simple for the designers to be reasonably priced.</p>\r\n \r\n<p>Skilled staff with knowledge of building products\' design, logic, and navigation is required for a product to operate without hiccups. Skilled and seasoned designers are more expensive than new freelancers or small design studios.</p>\r\n \r\n<p>As a result, the price of product design will be more if you want a high-quality, valuable product with exceptional functionality.</p>\r\n\r\n<h6>Nation of the contractor</h6>\r\n<p>The cost of product design is also influenced by the nation where your contractor is based. The most common areas where you can discover contractors have already been covered. As you can see, Eastern Europe is probably the finest choice because there are so many knowledgeable professionals there who provide their services at fair rates for product design.</p>\r\n \r\n<p>When Eastern European nations are considered, Ukraine is the most profitable location to find a design team. The government of Ukraine places a high priority on education, which supports a booming technology sector.</p>\r\n<p>Ukrainian IT workers have an average test score across all tests of 88.7%, according to data from HackerRank.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Although English is not commonly spoken by the general public, it is the primary language of the IT industry. As a result, there are few barriers to communication. Other benefits of outsourcing to Ukraine include its time zone\'s partial overlap with those of the US and UK and its similar work culture, which places a high priority on competition and competitive considerations.</p>\r\n\r\n<h6>Contractor history</h6>\r\n<p>Contractors are valued more highly and the cost of product design increases the longer they have been employed in the field. Ask your contractor to show you a portfolio of recently finished jobs and whether they have worked on projects similar to yours in the past to determine their level of experience.</p>\r\n \r\n<p>Visit their website and social media platforms as well. Examine the opinions of prior consumers. You may decide whether to invest time and money in this contractor once you have all the information you require.</p>\r\n\r\n<h6>Exemplified by cooperation</h6>\r\n<p>A model of cooperation is the last element that affects the price of product design.</p>\r\n \r\n<p>There are two categories of models available:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Fixed cost</li>\r\n<li>Model of time and materials (T&M)</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h6>Let\'s see how they are distinct from one another.</h6>\r\n \r\n<p>Under a fixed pricing approach, the client pays the contractor for the result at a predetermined cost and terms of work. The primary objectives are to meet the deadlines and stay within the budget while taking into account the extent of work and projected completion dates. Under this strategy, results and quality could suffer to meet deadlines and budgets.</p>\r\n \r\n<p>The price is known and determined in advance, which is the main advantage of this technique. However, you won\'t be able to during the design phase.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Additionally, the hourly charge for product design in this approach is often 15% to 20% higher than the Time & Material rate.</p>\r\n \r\n<p>Under the Time & Material model, the client pays for the procedure following the actual working time of the specialists. The outcome and quality are the most important factors, and the work\'s scope and implementation time are roughly estimated.</p>\r\n \r\n<p>The hourly pay of a product designer may be increased to produce better results or higher quality. Using this strategy, you will be able to alter the product design process, but you will have to pay more money. When deciding which of these two models to use, it is crucial to determine priorities and a budget.</p>\r\n\r\n<h6>The Product Design Team versus Freelancers. Should I outsource that?</h6>\r\n \r\n<p>You must trust experts with this process if you want a high-quality product design. There are two alternatives to pick from. You can work with a freelancer or get in touch with an organization that can offer you a qualified team for product design. Let\'s contrast these two possibilities.</p>\r\n \r\n \r\n<p>You must thoroughly comprehend each choice because both agencies and independent designers have benefits and drawbacks.</p>\r\n \r\n<p>The bulk of independent contractors bills less than design studios. Freelancers seem to be a sensible financial decision.</p>\r\n \r\n<p>If you have a little budget, are awaiting money from investors, or only need to construct one feature, that can be appealing to your business.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>An agency\'s services are typically more pricey. At first appearance, higher rates would seem to be a big disadvantage. The location of the agency has a significant impact on the pricing, though. As was already mentioned, Eastern European businesses offer highly skilled designers at fair pricing, ensuring that you don\'t overspend.</p>\r\n \r\n<p>Agencies offer a crucial quality/price ratio for a business because they offer complete end-to-end solutions. Working with an agency will also save you time and money because you won\'t have to supervise and manage a team of independent contractors.</p>\r\n \r\n<p>Even while there are many highly skilled professionals among freelancers, some are only interested in finishing the project, getting paid, and moving on to the next client.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>They could want to finish work as soon as they can because more clients equal more money. Some freelancers might not be concerned with quality. As a result, you must choose a contractor for your business with great care.</p>\r\n \r\n<p>Design firms, on the other hand, place a strong emphasis on sustaining long-term customer relationships and a reputation for professionalism. They prioritize building trust because they place a premium on quality rather than quantity.</p>\r\n \r\n<p>Employing a freelancer for a particular job or activity that requires their skills is simple. It is best to hire a design agency for complex long-term work. You need a larger design team the more complicated your project is.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Freelancers could first seem less expensive than agencies, but managing them will require more of your time. Therefore, working with an agency can end up saving you money over time.</p>\r\n \r\n<h6>DotOxygen Product Design Experience</h6>\r\n<p>For many years, the DotOxygen team has offered product design services.

(88, 7, 'DotOxygen', '05.07.2022', 'How to Build a Minimum Viable Product', '<p>Did you know that the original iPhone couldn\'t send media to a different iPhone? Bluetooth and Wi-Fi would not be applicable. In addition, it did not support 3G, did not have a \"copy and paste\" feature, and did not allow users to search their contacts or emails. At the time, each of these had previously been developed and was gaining popularity. Apple did not include all of these features in the original iPhone, though. Why? The fact is that the iPhone was an MVP (Minimum Viable Product), and creating the first touchscreen smartphone was a wonderful move.</p>\r\n\r\n<h5>What is an MVP?</h5>\r\n<p>The idea behind the MVP is that you should avoid adding all the redundant functionality while creating a new product or service. If not the method through which you test your idea, what exactly is an MVP in business? An MVP must only be fully useable in terms of resolving a single-user problem. That is its only criterion. All done. After that, you promote it and wait for user reaction while you accumulate power and resources.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In actuality, MVP emphasizes the process of learning about the product more than it does the actual itself. It is created to see if your audience would demand it rather than turn a profit. Additionally, it uses fewer materials and labor hours than the finished item.</p>\r\n \r\n<p>Your project or startup will work best if you wish to:</p>\r\n<ul> \r\n<li>Release in the shortest amount of time.</li>\r\n<li>Before spending the entire budget, collect input from actual users.</li>\r\n<li>Find out what your intended audience needs and what they don\'t.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>The MVP development process can have one of two results. The first approach is successful and assumes that you must identify ways to develop and improve your product. The second one is unsuccessful. In this instance, Budget losses and development time are kept to a minimum. Therefore, MVP is a safe blitzkrieg tactic.</p>\r\n\r\n<h6>What makes MVP useful?</h6>\r\n<p>Although learning is the main goal, there may be various other advantages. In addition to the market study, you can:</p>\r\n \r\n<ul> \r\n<li>Save time and money to use on the creation of the finished product. </li>\r\n<li>Get early customers\' suggestions for improvement as soon as possible.</li>\r\n<li>Assemble your first user base. </li>\r\n<li>By soliciting investors during the MVP stage, you can gain shareholders early. </li>\r\n<li>Due to low functionality, fewer remakes are required. </li>\r\n<li>If your project is found to be unsuccessful, save your time and money for another one.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>It\'s crucial to stress that these advantages are a bonus. Finding out if your product will sell is of utmost importance.</p>\r\n\r\n<h6>An MVP is not what?</h6>\r\n<p>It\'s crucial to set MVP apart from other concepts that can initially seem comparable.</p>\r\n \r\n<h6>Prototype</h6>\r\n \r\n<p>First off, remember that an MVP and a prototype are two distinct ideas. The MVP should be released to the market for testing, as opposed to the prototype, which has the duty of presenting the idea. It implies that, despite its restricted features, MVP must be completely marketable.</p>\r\n\r\n<h6>Finished item</h6>\r\n<p>A product\'s MVP is the version that needs to be upgraded. While determining if the main feature of your product will be in demand with customers is the MVP\'s primary responsibility, it will also assist you in making decisions about new features and other upgrades. It offers you the chance to innovate, adapt, and overcome while also serving as the foundation for your eventual product.</p>\r\n \r\n<h6>Abandoning your objectives</h6>\r\n<p>Last but not least, an MVP is nothing more than a tool for gathering consumer feedback. In plain English, MVP is about the learning process rather than making money off of the prototype or another item. You should stay away from those characteristics.</p>\r\n\r\n<h6>Examples</h6>\r\n<p>Most people either forgot about or were unaware of the earliest iterations of the greatest minimum viable product examples:</p>\r\n \r\n<h6>Amazon</h6>\r\n \r\n<p>Amazon started out selling books on the internet. Their website has a straightforward user experience that didn\'t appear to have taken much time to create. Their main rival was Barnes & Noble, a traditional bookseller that sold its goods through mail catalogs. Although the new strategy helped Amazon succeed, it is MVP that has demonstrated the viability of online retailing and enabled the business to develop into what it is today.</p>\r\n\r\n<h6>Spotify</h6>\r\n<p>Spotify\'s primary function was music streaming. This Swedish startup began by creating a desktop program in a restricted beta testing model. After their MVP was successful, they created a mobile app and began negotiating deals with musicians from the US and other countries.</p>\r\n<h6>Uber</h6>\r\n<p>The Uber app allowed customers who dared to enable credit card payments to connect with cab drivers in San Francisco. This strategy made it possible to develop inexpensive services that gained popularity quickly. The company didn\'t offer services like car rentals, couriers, food delivery, and other types of delivery until much later.</p>\r\n\r\n<h6>How is a Minimum Viable Product created?</h6>\r\n<p>You might want to construct your minimal viable product now that you are aware of what it is, but please be patient. Although explanations and examples may seem straightforward, you will need some guidance if you wish to construct MVP on your own. The six steps of the MVP development process are listed below to help you move from an original concept to a sellable product.</p>\r\n \r\n<h6>An Issue is an Opportunity</h6>\r\n<p>Your MVP should initially have a single function. A product is successful if it can help your customers with their problems. To comprehend how the good or service you provide can benefit your customer, you should put yourself in their position.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>You can use a more individualized approach if the procedure of searching for issues in a certain market group is ineffective. Just consider a problem that you are currently experiencing and that other people find annoying. But unlike them, you can create a tool to address it more successfully, rapidly, or affordably.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n', '12710-how_to_build_a_minimum_viable_product.png', 'Branding, Website Design, Website Development, User Interface, User Experience', '2005-07-20 21:00:00.00000', '05.07.2022'),

Because of this, this post will explain how to pick a web design firm. You will gain a better understanding of how to start your search process and what to consider while choosing your applicants.</p>\r\n \r\n<h5>How Should I Go About Picking a Web Design Company?</h5>\r\n<p>You can start your search for a web development firm in several well-liked ways. They\'re not all effective. Some might even cause you to look in the wrong place.</p>\r\n\r\n<h6>Search on Google</h6>\r\n<p>The first, and most typical, strategy suggests just searching for the \"best web development businesses.\" It\'s quite an audacious way to begin considering that you will immediately be presented with hundreds of Google pages, each of which claims to link to the Best Company in the World. You should realize, though, that there is no such thing as \"the greatest\" in today\'s fiercely competitive industry. Even if a company appears on the first page of Google, it probably means that it spent a lot of money on SEO or advertising. It is not the most trustworthy factor to use when picking a web design company.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There may occasionally be only one link to a single company\'s website in articles titled \"Top 10 Web Development Companies.\" Nothing more than self-promotion. You may usually dismiss such items because they won\'t provide you with an unbiased opinion.</p>\r\n \r\n<p>The \"How to Understand Whether a Website Development Company Is Good?\" section can be read, nevertheless, if your Google searches were successful and you have already identified a few interesting businesses.</p>\r\n\r\n<h6>Someone\'s Suggestion</h6>\r\n<p>Sometimes it seems like the best decision to choose a web design firm based on recommendations from friends, business colleagues, or even family members. But just because something works for someone else does not guarantee that it will work for you as well. a basic principle that applies practically everywhere. For instance, your friend, business partner, or family may have used that company\'s mobile app development services, and everything went smoothly and the outcome was perfect. However, this does not necessarily imply that the seller is as skilled at web design as he is at mobile development; alternatively, this organization may lack sufficient expertise in Your field.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Search on Quora Quora is a fantastic place to start because you may see the viewpoints of many people there and occasionally discover some honest responses to your query. Start by searching on Quora for terms like \"What are the greatest web development businesses\" and you\'ll undoubtedly come across a question that\'s well-liked and has lots of helpful responses.</p>\r\n \r\n<p>Utilize both facts and emotions to find the solutions that add value. Observe someone\'s response to the question with care. They may just attempt to provide as many connections as they can and provide you with impersonal, corporate data at other times. I am aware that there are too many questions and that you are unable to personally respond to each one.  However, there are also a lot of clients and tasks. If they are unable to accomplish it, they will probably struggle to provide a quality web product for their subsequent client.</p>\r\n \r\n<p>Real facts and a unique perspective are what make your Quora response perfect. Instead of just stating that they are \"the finest,\" it ought to explain why this specific company is good.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<h5>How can I tell if a website development company is reputable?</h5>\r\n<p>You are now on their website after choosing a few prospects. What ought you do now? View their references and available work.</p>\r\n \r\n<h6>1. Examine reviews left by previous clients.</h6>\r\n<p>One of the finest ways to assess the agency\'s credibility and experience is to read testimonials. Be cautious, nevertheless, that some web development companies fabricate client testimonials. If there is only a basic written review and a picture of the reviewer without any reference to the source of the feedback, it is probably a fake. In certain cases, you can even make out word patterns that indicate a single author was responsible for the evaluations from many clients. Undoubtedly, one of the most glaring signs that a firm is unreliable is the presence of phony testimonials.</p>\r\n<p>A good business always links all of the client testimonials to their Clutch or/and Good Firms accounts. If you located a business via a Clutch search, you\'ve probably already read the reviews and are happy with it. In this situation, you should see their portfolio right immediately to learn more.</p>\r\n\r\n<h6>2. View the Portfolio of the Company</h6>\r\n<p>Any web development company\'s website should often have a section called cases/case studies/portfolio where you can view some of their prior efforts. They\'ll share their success tales and past performance with you. Examine the case studies more closely to gauge their general quality and usability. Check to see if their communication style fits your requirements and professional goals. You should also check them because the majority of such instances typically provide links to the completed job.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Check the company\'s portfolio to check if they have created any websites for clients in your business or at least closely related ones. You might get a great idea of how your project could have appeared from these specific works. Even if your candidate lacks sufficient experience in the targeted area, make sure they have enough experience developing software for a variety of other businesses.</p>\r\n \r\n<p>You can occasionally view more of their work on their Dribbble or Behance page to gain additional insights.</p>\r\n\r\n<h6>3. Check to see how the web development firm responds to your message.</h6>\r\n<p>You are now prepared to greet your new acquaintances. Observing how quickly and how people reply to your initial communication is the next crucial stage. Although it can seem small, keep in mind that the devil is in the details.</p>\r\n<p>Check their response time to your message first. The ideal time frame is 24 hours. Why is it significant? Now imagine that you hired this company to create a website for you and chose to inquire about the progress as the deadline draws near. They ignore you for a few days before giving you a product that is only partially complete an hour before the deadline. Not the best experience, would you say? A key component of effective cooperation is responsiveness, and it begins with the first message.</p>\r\n \r\n<p>Next, observe how they respond to your message. They ought to be interested in finding out more about your web development project and comprehending the objectives and requirements of your company.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If everything is going well so far, attempt to schedule a call so you may speak to someone right away. Check to see if they are approachable and friendly. They ought to be curious about your business and the specifics of the project, not just open to being sold to. Examine your chemistry with one another. You might need it because you\'ll be working with this company for several months, if not longer.</p>\r\n \r\n<p>You will undoubtedly select a decent one if you bear these factors in mind.</p>\r\n\r\n<h5>Last Thoughts</h5>\r\n<p>Although picking a web design company is a simple procedure, you need to pay attention to the little things.

(91, 9, 'DotOxygen', '11.06.2022', 'How to Create a Retail App for Your Business', '<p>Retail behemoths frequently lack a complete understanding of how their chain is operating. They frequently have hundreds of stores, all with varying levels of efficiency. As a result, there is a good probability that the need for particular products inside a huge chain will go unnoticed.</p>\r\n \r\n<p>Remember that smaller firms nevertheless face challenges. They face competition from both industry titans and other small retailers.</p>\r\n \r\n<p>No matter how big or little your company is, your rivals are watching for you to slip up. They provide products that you don\'t. In the blink of an eye, your competition gains your customers.</p>\r\n \r\n<p>How should this issue be handled? Technology is the solution. Create a retail app that benefits your consumers and gathers data so they can make wise decisions.</p>\r\n\r\n<h6>Let\'s begin:</h6>\r\n\r\n<h4>A retail app: What is it?</h4>\r\n<p>A retail app is a piece of software that connects buyers and sellers on one platform, ideally a mobile application. You will be able to get a variety of advantages if you decide to build your shopping app, including improved user experience, which will help you attract new customers, gather crucial data on your users\' purchasing patterns, personalize their experiences, and increase your revenue. Later in the article, we shall go into more detail on this subject.</p>\r\n \r\n<p>For both merchants and buyers, retail applications provide a fresh, inventive, and efficient shopping experience.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Let\'s now look at some statistics that show why you ought to develop a shopping app. The market for online retail is expanding rapidly. This market has grown eight times in the USA alone between 2013 and 2020. Statista estimates that by 2020, the market, which was worth $41.7 billion in 2013, will be worth $338 billion. Businesses that don\'t sell products online run the risk of quickly becoming incompatible as expansion increases.</p>\r\nWhy Is It Important to Build Your Own Shopping App?\r\n \r\n<p>Technology may expand your firm in a variety of ways. But in this essay, we\'ll concentrate on the most important ones.</p>\r\n \r\n<h6>The capacity to boost the potential for business growth</h6>\r\n<p>Probably the most practical method to become worldwide is online. Building a retail app will increase your revenue, engage new users, expand your market reach, and win you credibility. Each of these elements helps your company expand overall.</p>\r\n\r\n<h6>How to Draw in New Audiences</h6>\r\n<p>As was already said, shopping apps offer a singular opportunity to attract brand-new customers without effective marketing initiatives. Why is that? First of all, Gen Z customers, who view the world through their smartphones, are more likely to utilize your shopping app if you create it yourself. Many folks also don\'t have the time or prefer to shop at brick-and-mortar establishments. Some people avoid gatherings because they are terrified of COVID-19.</p>\r\n \r\n<p>Even Nevertheless, these individuals are wealthy and desire to shop. Therefore, if you provide them with high-quality service, they are likely to stick with you.</p>\r\n\r\n<h6>Raising the Bar on the Quality of Your Services</h6>\r\n<p>Any business must prioritize customer satisfaction, and online retail is no different. Offering a seamless user experience is the key to successfully developing a retail app. You can advance your services if your app is user-friendly, well-designed, and responsive.</p>\r\n \r\n<p>Additionally, you will be able to identify the usage habits of your consumers if you incorporate technologies like big data, machine learning, and artificial intelligence into your retail app. As a result, you will be able to anticipate rising demand for specific products and ensure their supply (for example, candy before Halloween). Additionally, by being aware of these tendencies, you will be able to offer a more tailored user experience.</p>\r\n\r\n<h6>Increasing Your Company\'s Accessibility</h6>\r\n<p>Online retail is significantly more accessible than offline retail. Your users may easily access your selection and are not restricted to a specific area. There are still certain restrictions, though. For instance, shipping systems operate differently and adhere to different regulations depending on the country.</p>\r\n \r\n<p>Take your time while developing your shopping app to consider how to guarantee a seamless delivery process so that you can become known as a reliable shopping app.</p>\r\n\r\n<h6>Developing Client Trust</h6>\r\n<p>Even though internet shopping is becoming more and more popular, many consumers are still reluctant to make online purchases. They are reluctant to enter the billing information since they are mostly worried about security issues. Therefore, you must take all reasonable steps to establish a reputation as a reliable retailer.</p>\r\n \r\n<p>However, developing a retail app is a great approach to earning confidence in the retail sector if you maintain the highest level of payment security and offer top-notch services.</p>\r\n\r\n<h6>An Alternative to Communication</h6>\r\n<p>Any mobile application must include a certain amount of voice tone. It might draw in new customers, express your values, and direct people within your shopping app. Therefore, it is a good idea to take your time and consider what you want to say with your application if you are creating a shopping app.</p>\r\n \r\n<p>Building a retail app might therefore have a variety of advantages. But is spending money on custom applications really necessary? Or would a premade solution suffice? Let\'s look into it.</p>\r\n\r\n<h6>Custom retail software or a pre-made option</h6>\r\n\r\n<p>Your firm will normally be more successful with custom applications. This is why. You have the freedom to select only the features you require when using custom solutions. Depending on your needs, timeframe, and financial constraints, you get to pick the partner you\'ll work with. Therefore, it is a good idea to develop a unique shopping app.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<h6>The Complete Process of Making Your Own Shopping App</h6>\r\n\r\n<h6>1. Choose a partner for your app development.</h6>\r\n<p>Here is a list of things to think about before entering into a contract with a particular service provider who can assist you in creating a shopping app.</p>\r\n \r\n<p>Examine the partner\'s portfolio, read through client endorsements, and keep an eye on the sectors they work in.</p>\r\n\r\n<h6>2. Create a Project Plan and Requirements document</h6>\r\n<p>It\'s critical to express your issues and goals in detail if you want to develop a retail app successfully. By doing this, you may ensure that your vendor is aware of your expectations for them. Your team won\'t be able to create a successful shopping app without clear specifications.\r\nAn overview of the project, your aims and goals, your target market, the feature set you need, recommendations, references, restrictions, and more are typically included in the document with the requirements to design a shopping app.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Spend some time creating detailed project requirements before beginning to construct a retail app.</p>\r\n \r\n<p>The essential components you must incorporate are:</p>\r\n <ul>\r\n <li>the project\'s summary</li>\r\n<li>your business objectives</li>\r\n<li>time and financial restrictions</li>\r\n<li>competitor analyses</li>\r\n<li>target audience needs</li>\r\n<li>features you\'d like to add</li>\r\n<li>market standards (such as legal regulations) that should be taken into account.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h6>3. Launch Product Research</h6>\r\n<p>Although there are other methods for finding new products, we\'ll concentrate on what we do at DotOxygen. Our professionals thoroughly investigate the market and analyze the target market and competitors.</p>\r\n<p>Additionally, we must define the business, user, and discovery goals at this point, as well as produce user stories and customer journey maps. All of these actions aid in understanding information about the intended product, the market it will serve, its target market, and more.</p>\r\n \r\n<h6>4. Begin creating a UX design</h6>\r\n<p>It is crucial to make sure that the UX goals are defined clearly when developing a shopping app. Once you have the necessary data, you can start creating the shopping app.</p>\r\n<p>Making design judgments, creating prototypes of your ideas, and obtaining user feedback.</p>\r\n<p>When we assist you in developing your shopping app, we construct a roadmap based on the concept of the application and its design to begin the UX design process. Wireframes and information architecture are created at this stage.</p>\r\n\r\n<h6>5. Commence UI Design</h6>\r\n<p>As soon as the UX design is complete and tested, move on to the UI. The most important component of the UI design phase is consistency. Experts from Northell will make sure that all interface components are uniform.</p>\r\n \r\n<h6>6. Conduct a user test</h6>\r\n<p>The prototype can be perfected throughout the testing phase. Interviews with focus groups, assessment studies, and usability reports are the three main phases of testing.</p>\r\n<p>The DotOxygen UX Lab is one of the shining instances of user experience testing. In our lab, the user is given a prototype. Eye-tracking technology records a user\'s behavior while they interact with the product. The system then shows the data, allowing for comparison between analytical data and data from actual use. This will be used to tweak the product and improve usability.</p>\r\n \r\n<p>You may make a shopping app that will be user-friendly by using this method of user testing.</p>\r\n\r\n<h6>7. Streamline Your Development Process to Create Your Own Shopping App (SDLC)</h6>\r\n<p>When creating a retail app, the development phase is perhaps the most important. It is a thorough process that calls for a variety of actions. At DotOxygen, we follow these steps:</p>\r\n \r\n<ul>\r\n <li>Product Technical Documentation Creation</li>\r\n \r\n<p>In this phase, we gather all the client\'s data and create the final product following their specifications. Teams select technical stacks and develop technical documentation.</p>\r\n \r\n<p>The team should now confirm the estimate and the work scope, as well as specify the requirements for functionality and user roles.</p>\r\n\r\n <li>Development</li>\r\n \r\n<p>When you create a retail app, the entire development process functions like an orchestra where several professionals collaborate to guarantee a seamless delivery. Yes, front-end developers are in charge of the application\'s client-side functionality. The creation of APIs and databases is the responsibility of back-end developers. CI/CD process is being worked on by the DevOps team.</p>\r\n\r\n<li>Testing</li>\r\n \r\n<p>QA engineers test all provided code and create automated tests for developed components throughout this stage of the development of the shopping app.</p>\r\n \r\n<li>Installation & Integration</li>\r\n \r\n<p>The tested version of the software is given to users for beta testing following development and regression testing from the QA team. Along with gathering user feedback, the team also implements improvements, patches issues, and fixes.</p>\r\n<li>Maintenance</li>\r\n<p>The maintenance phase follows a product\'s rollout. The development team is in charge of all these tasks at this point if a problem arises that needs to be solved or if something needs to be enhanced.</p>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h6>8. Start</h6>\r\n<p>The market is ready to see your retail app now! The procedure for launching a product should be followed precisely. The essential steps for an effective product launch procedure are as follows:</p>\r\n \r\n<p>Identifying the target market; Creating the unique product packaging; Creating the slogan and timeframe; Analyzing the competition; Creating the customer onboarding process; Creating the website; and Advertising</p>\r\n<p>For our clients, Northell professionals are skilled in resolving a wide range of issues.</p>\r\n \r\n<p>Additionally, we are aware of the characteristics that will help your shopping app succeed. Together, let\'s look at this.</p>\r\n\r\n<h5>How we can help?</h5>\r\n\r\n<p>DotOxygen has a history of assisting clients in completing projects successfully. You will be assisted in successfully developing a shopping app by our team of qualified designers, developers, project managers, business analysts, solution architects, and other experts.</p>\r\n \r\n<p>The DotOxygen team assists B2B and B2C businesses with their digitalization efforts. We create solutions that aid in accelerating corporate growth. We have assisted clients from 45+ countries globally and completed 155+ projects, including e-commerce, effectively.</p>\r\n \r\n<p>For instance, we collaborated with Needl, a platform that connects buyers and sellers to business prospects (leads). Its current focus is on achieving a solid product-market fit in the FMCG retail business (food, drinks, and cosmetics).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The partner approached us with a platform that wasn\'t in line with the new positioning for the Needl product (messages, visuals), and he wanted to create an elegant, contemporary, and polished design. In addition, we were in charge of creating additional application areas.</p>\r\n \r\n<p>We approached the project in a very thorough manner. According to the most recent trends, we updated the logo and design system and created the main features for the industry.</p>\r\n \r\n<p>For two personas, we created more user-friendly navigation and improved the dashboard\'s UI/UX. We also provided new features. Tech Stack: Swift and Kotlin</p>\r\n \r\n<p>We, therefore, assisted in aligning Needl\'s positioning.</p>\r\n\r\n<h6>Features of retail apps in 2022</h6>\r\n<p>We will concentrate on more complex features in this section that will facilitate the development of a profitable retail app. You undoubtedly require capabilities like search, filters, product categories, adding a bank card, etc., but we won\'t linger on these fundamentals in this article.</p>\r\n\r\n<h6>Individual account</h6>\r\n<p>You must make it possible to join your shopping app. It should be possible for the user to enter personal data, add payment cards, browse personal offerings, etc. The purchasing history should also be included in this area.</p>\r\n \r\n<h6>Take a look</h6>\r\n \r\n<p>Any retail app needs to prioritize secure checkout. Therefore, be careful to incorporate a secure payment system within your application (such as PayPal, Apple Pay, Google Pay, etc.) to make payments easy and secure.</p>\r\n \r\n<h6>Clever filters</h6>\r\n<p>With the rapid search dropdown, smart filters provide your consumers with the appropriate results. Everything you need to encourage them to buy is available in the search bar. For instance, you can substitute \"no results page\" with \"automatic fast suggestions,\" \"spell check\" and \"auto-correction\" results in items, categories, and pages. You can also include product reviews and live prices, in-stock information, ratings, \"Did you mean\" ideas, and synonyms.</p>\r\n\r\n<h6>Chatbot</h6>\r\n<p>An excellent suggestion is to lend a hand. For instance, you can use chatbots to assist your consumers in choosing the products that are the greatest fit for them or determining whether they are currently accessible.</p>\r\n \r\n<h6>System of reminders and notifications</h6>\r\n<p>Many products need to be supplied continuously. However, many people find it challenging to remember to make all the necessary purchases. So it makes sense to assist them and inform them of new offerings, admissions, etc.</p>\r\n \r\n<h6>Discount program</h6>\r\n<p>One of your key priorities should be developing a base of devoted customers. Personal offers, exclusive discounts, and promo coupons for frequent users are all means by which you can increase the user base of your shopping app.</p>\r\n\r\n<h6>AR/VR</h6>\r\n<p>Retail is being dominated by virtual and augmented reality. For instance, these technologies are frequently employed by online clothes retailers. Customers may determine whether a product matches them by using AR and VR to see how it will appear in real life.</p>\r\n\r\n<h5>Things to Consider Before Developing a Retail App</h5>\r\n \r\n<h6>A competent staff must be present.</h6>\r\n \r\n<p>You\'ll need an experienced team if you want to build a successful shopping app. In this instance, collaboration is necessary for good project delivery. Making a shopping app requires:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>those who write code for software.</li>\r\n<li>designers who create a beautiful shopping app for you.</li>\r\n<li>testers accountable for the quality of the code.</li>\r\n<li>tasks are managed by a project manager.</li>\r\n<li>business analyst to comprehend the needs and situation of the industry.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h6>Additionally Vital Is A Marketing Strategy</h6>\r\n<p>Your business\'s success depends only in part on the creation of shopping apps. The rest consists of clever marketing tactics and advertising. You must increase the user\'s trust in your goods through your marketing initiatives.</p>\r\n \r\n<p>The following three marketing pillars require strict attention:</p>\r\n <ul>\r\n<li>how much you spend on marketing</li>\r\n<li>the seniority and performance of the marketing personnel</li>\r\n<li>the effectiveness of your business concept</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>Additionally, the success of your content-based marketing has a significant impact on the organic growth of your organization. You should start working on creating a website if it doesn\'t already exist or if it doesn\'t contain any information about your goods.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A possible option is to purchase app design through an outsourcing company.</p>\r\n<p>Various sources claim that outsourcing the development of a retail app can reduce costs by 30% to 60%. As a result, many businesses decide to do it to reduce costs.</p>\r\n \r\n<p><bold>But what is the actual price? Let\'s investigate.</bold></p>\r\n \r\n<h6>What is the price of a retail app?</h6>\r\n<p>Mobile app development and design costs vary by region, just as in any other industry, largely due to local cost of living factors. In addition, the cost is influenced by several other parameters, including workload, task difficulty, and the seniority of the task performers.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The three most common locations for outsourcing are Eastern Europe, Asia, and Latin America. Each of these places is unique, and the costs vary accordingly. Let\'s look at the price of developing a retail app using suppliers from these locations.</p>\r\n \r\n<h6>Making your shopping app costs money in Eastern Europe</h6>\r\n \r\n<p>The price of developing a retail app in Eastern Europe varies by nation. Yes, Ukrainian developers of mobile apps charge less than their counterparts in Poland or Romania. In general, rates are lower in countries where the cost of living is lower. Therefore, we advise adding the Numbeo cost of living index to the calculation.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Eastern European pricing for mobile app development is depending on seniority level.</p>\r\n \r\n<p>A junior mobile app developer will cost you about $35 per hour, while a senior will cost you about $50 per hour, according to the seniority of the local specialists.</p>\r\n\r\n<h6>Making a retail app costs money: Asia</h6>\r\n \r\n<p>The going rate for a junior mobile app developer in Asia is $10–$15, and the going rate for a senior mobile app developer is $20–$30.</p>\r\n \r\n<p>Despite having the lowest unemployment rates in the world, Asia lags behind other regions in terms of digital adoption and Internet quality. These elements could make it difficult for you to work with Asian developers, so be cautious.</p>\r\n\r\n<h6>Making a retail app costs money: Latin America</h6>\r\n \r\n<p>Geographic closeness and a short time difference are two important considerations that influence firms (mostly US-based ones) to outsource mobile app development to Latin America.</p>\r\n \r\n<p>Expect to pay between $30 and $50 per hour for junior employees to work on your mobile app if you opt to recruit one in Mexico, Argentina, or another Latin American nation.</p>\r\n\r\n<h6>By project size, the cost of developing mobile applications</h6>\r\n<p>Typically, we categorize projects into the startup, medium, and enterprise levels based on their complexity.</p>\r\n \r\n<p>The cost of creating an application also relies on the scope of your project. Small or startup initiatives are less expensive because they take less time to develop and have fewer professionals engaged. Startup-level projects take about 150 hours to build on average.</p>\r\n\r\n<h6>Project schedule</h6>\r\n<p>The size of your business, the complexity of your app, the experience level of your staff, and other factors can affect timing just like they can affect cost. Even the simplest jobs, meanwhile, take time to complete. To make this procedure as quick as possible, it is to your best advantage to cooperate with competent professionals.</p>\r\n \r\n<p>Knowing the timing will help you estimate your project cost because the time you spend on the actual development determines the majority of the cost of mobile app development.</p>\r\n\r\n<h6>Last thoughts</h6>\r\n<p>How do you successfully design your shopping app? It involves several stages and is fraught with difficulties.</p>\r\n \r\n<p>You require a capable group of analysts, sales managers, developers, designers, and other professionals. But if you work with a trustworthy source, this journey becomes more manageable.</p>\r\n', '264666-how_to_choose_a_web_design_company.jpg', 'Branding, Website Design, Website Development, User Interface, User Experience', '2011-06-20 21:00:00.00000', '11.06.2022');

Let\'s examine them carefully:\r\nDon\'t just copy something.</p>\r\n<p>You shouldn\'t duplicate the full Yelp website. It is completely illogical. If users are already accustomed to using Yelp, why would they visit the same website? Offering people something brand-new that they haven\'t seen before is crucial. This is referred to as a distinctive selling feature or proposal.</p>\r\n \r\n<p>What sets your solution apart from others and what your rivals\' platforms lack are your unique selling factors. You must invest more time and effort if you want to build an app similar to Yelp and make it even more popular.</p>\r\n<p>As long as they are all pertinent and do not duplicate what your rivals currently offer, you are free to develop as many USPs as you can. Anything would work if you implemented it right, whether it be a unique design element that makes navigating easier, an AI-based chatbot that finds the exact information you need more quickly, or perhaps a stunning user interface.</p>\r\n\r\n<h5>What issue does your solution address?</h5>\r\n<p>You must identify the primary user problem your platform has to solve to be in demand. If this is a platform similar to Yelp, then the key issue that customers should be able to browse reviews and recommendations for is discovering the necessary services.</p>\r\n \r\n<p>To the primary objective of the platform, you can add more. But keep in mind that the major one ought to be visible from the platform. Users don\'t have to spend much time looking for what they need when using your platform. You must design your platform such that users may use it to quickly solve their issues and accomplish their objectives.</p>\r\n\r\n<h5>How can you support the enterprises of others?</h5>\r\n<p>Finding out how you can assist businesses is also crucial. People provide information about their companies in the hopes that it will help them in some way. And it\'s crucial to establish specific guidelines for this if you want people to keep utilizing your platform to broadcast information about their business. For instance, it may involve advertising, generating more leads, becoming more well-known, hiring new people, or receiving accolades.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The most crucial factors are informational credibility and trust.\r\nYou must gain the trust of your audience if you want as many individuals as possible to visit your platform. Don\'t release unreliable information. After all, you can frame someone this way.</p>\r\n \r\n<p>We advise that you choose your content for publication with care and periodically verify the veracity of the information provided and the integrity of the company that publishes this information.</p>\r\n \r\n<h5>Develop a Unique Yelp-like App</h5>\r\n<h6>1. A distinct style</h6>\r\n<p>You should first establish a distinctive design if you want to make a Yelp-like application that is different. This is already a success if your application differs from Yelp, for instance. Consider the primary colors you\'ll employ in the design. Choose your branding as well. For instance, you want to have a catchy motto and logo.</p>\r\n \r\n<p>Don\'t overlook the visual organization of the items in your application, either. The advertisement should stand out from the competition.</p>\r\n<h6>2. Special knowledge</h6>\r\n<p>Your application should contain unique information. You might publish information about unusual businesses or locations, for instance. Customers will remain with you for a very long time if they read positive evaluations about a business that they have been looking for for a very long time.</p>\r\n \r\n<p>Additionally, include original articles, reviews (perhaps presented in an unconventional manner), and advice in the application. Always keep in mind that originality is the secret to success.</p>\r\n\r\n<h6>3. Have a specialty. No longer do we need a second Yelp.</h6>\r\n<p>Naturally, it\'s cool when your platform provides answers to as many needs as it can and allows you to get information on nearly anything in one location. But with websites and applications like Yelp, it\'s preferable to keep things straightforward and offer a top-notch solution for a select few client demands.</p>\r\n \r\n<p>It\'s typically very difficult, if not impossible, to find enough reviews on each of the institutions listed on a platform that offers reviews about home service providers, supermarkets, law firms, and several other institutions from around the world. Offering something in one area and making it as thorough and useful as you can is considerably simpler.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Additionally, it\'s crucial to comprehend the qualities that will work best in any situation. For instance, you wouldn\'t need to include a photo upload function if you were building a platform for legal firms, but it would be crucial for a website or app for restaurant reviews.</p>\r\n\r\n<h6>4. Special offer to users</h6>\r\n<p>We have already discussed the importance to provide your users with something special if you want your application to be popular. Consider what your application\'s best features might be. Make it one thing, but make it worthwhile.</p>\r\n \r\n<p>For instance, if your application allows users to rate and review various wine varieties and wineries, you can only provide user ratings that come from trained sommeliers. Reviews written by non-specialists have no chance of being published. As a result, you provide users with valuable and high-quality content.</p>\r\n\r\n<h5>What Elements Should a Professional Review App Have?</h5>\r\n<p>Consider what should be included if you want to build a fantastic Yelp-like app. Even if your product has a tonne of special selling qualities, if it lacks the essential components, it is still ineffective.</p>\r\n \r\n<p>We\'ve already compiled a list of the review platform necessities if you don\'t want to fail even before launch.</p>\r\n \r\n<p>Although some of them may vary from niche to niche, you must always make sure to execute the majority of them right away.</p>\r\n\r\n<h6>Ratings and Reviews</h6>\r\n<p>Sounds absurd, innit? Not all of the currently used platforms, nevertheless, have everything done correctly in these words. You might not even continue with your tool development if you don\'t include a user-friendly and thorough review page, or even just a handy remark box.</p>\r\n \r\n<p>How can it seem nice? Add a quick \"like\" and \"dislike\" button, as well as a comment field with no symbol limit, so that everyone could write as much as they want to make their review truly valuable. Separate the entire review tab into the major factors that affect the overall rating (quality of service, price-quality ratio, overall impression, etc., depending on the area of interest).</p>\r\n<p>Users should be able to benefit from search filters as well. They could then see the most recent or popular remarks regarding a particular good or service, the greatest (most reputable) solutions, or the best reviewers.</p>\r\n\r\n<h6>User profiles</h6>\r\n<p>It\'s crucial for customers as well as companies who share their product or service pages on review platforms. This enables customer service personnel to interact with clients and assist them in resolving problems, facilitating a recent negative experience, or expressing gratitude for a kind word.</p>\r\n \r\n<p>Additionally, user accounts give companies the ability to amend their pages, and change cover photographs or descriptions in the event of a rebranding, significant revisions, or the introduction of new services, tools, or features.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Users can save other people\'s reviews if they were planning to try a particular product or service, become more active users, see and store all of their reviews, and receive special milestones (if applicable). The majority of people must register to provide a useful, pertinent comment because it is frequently a need to do so.</p>\r\n\r\n<h6>Uploads of pictures / videos</h6>\r\n<p>Although not required for every specialty, the majority of review systems still provide this capability. Even stronger evidence than mere words is posting a photo or a video taken at a specific location.</p>\r\n \r\n<p>If someone claims they had a meal at a restaurant that was horrendously provided, they can provide proof. You can film a video so that other people can hear it too if a music hall or nightclub had a poor sound system. You should be able to show a manufacturer the broken accessory if you purchased it from an internet jewelry store.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>People don\'t, however, post images or videos simply to demonstrate how poorly they were treated. The majority of the time, individuals use them to demonstrate why a location is worthwhile visiting, and they are considerably more valuable than simply well-written comments. Therefore, if your platform\'s niche requires that, offer this option right away.</p>\r\n\r\n<h6>Filters and location-based search</h6>\r\n<p>An additional crucial component for any review platform. The integrated map that shows all the locations of the places you\'re interested in is typically included. This saves time and allows you to focus on finding what you\'re looking for. By turning on a filter, you can restrict your search to the closest coffee shops, the cheapest supermarkets, or the best hair salons.</p>\r\n \r\n<p>These little but crucial features help users find what they\'re looking for more quickly throughout the process. As a result, consumers find what they need much more quickly than usual.</p>\r\n\r\n<h6>Business websites</h6>\r\n<p>As was already noted, review platforms typically offer unique pages for company owners, enabling them to interact with clients and increase brand recognition. A company page is what you need right away if you want to attract more potential partners to your platform. Additionally, your website or app will soon become a more reliable source of reviews the more company accounts it has.</p>\r\n<h6>Check-ins</h6>\r\n<p>A platform like Foursquare offers this feature. A check-in option is exactly what you need to encourage greater user participation. People can use it to get a certain badge or award for unlocking a particular category, share the location with their friends, or store the place they\'ve been to remember it and return to it later.</p>\r\n<p>Consider the ways you can represent it if your platform allows you to implement anything similar. When you strive to assist and amuse your consumers at the same time, it\'s always cool. Users will remain more active on your website or app as a result.</p>\r\n\r\n<h6>Tools for quick sign-in and sign-up</h6>\r\n<p>Nobody enjoys filling out lengthy registration forms, and not everyone saves their passwords on their laptops or other devices. You ought to make your login page as straightforward as you can because of this.</p>\r\n \r\n<p>People typically make accounts using their social networking or email info, so you only need to enter that to save them time when creating a profile. Additionally, add a \"Remember me\" box for the sign-in option so that users won\'t have to input their password each time they access a website or app.</p>\r\n<p>Last but not least, if you\'re also building a mobile app, make sure to include a Touch and Face ID sign-in; your users will appreciate it.</p>\r\n\r\n<h6>Notifications</h6>\r\n<p>Yes, we are making every effort to do away with push notifications. For review platforms, though, it\'s a crucial method of receiving crucial changes, especially if you have a corporate account.</p>\r\n \r\n<p>You can check your notifications to see if you\'ve received a negative rating or a response to one of your comments. It\'s a crucial feature that makes it easier to stay in touch with people and respond to events as quickly as possible to guarantee effective communication between a business owner and a client.</p>\r\n \r\n<p>Therefore, don\'t neglect to include this option in your review platform, regardless of how negatively consumers now see notifications.</p>\r\n\r\n<h6>Sponsorship</h6>\r\n<p>Anyone who wants to post advertisements on your platform can do so using this tool. People will be able to market their businesses thanks to this, and you\'ll make more money. However, it is important to plan and decide the terms on which advertising will be placed. People may pay for views or ad clicks. Everything is up to how you feel most at ease.</p>\r\n\r\n<h6>Generation of content</h6>\r\n<p>You require a content creation feature if you want users to be able to swiftly and easily generate publications in your application. The option to create different publications with the opportunity to contribute photographs, videos, reviews, comments, etc. should be part of it. It is crucial to provide the capability of later content editing with this functionality.</p>\r\n \r\n<h6>Listing and recognition</h6>\r\n<p>We are confident that displaying companies, services, and products as useful lists will be convenient for your users. A fun option would be to include awards. Your users will be able to view, for instance, the most well-known companies or those that have won any awards, in this manner.</p>\r\n\r\n<h6>Verifications</h6>\r\n<p>This functionality is necessary to ensure that only authenticated information enters your website. For instance, a company must first go through the verification procedure by submitting all the essential data demonstrating its reliability before it can publish information about itself on its website. Some systems, for instance, will call a company representative.</p>\r\n \r\n<h6>Cashback</h6>\r\n<p>A feature called cashback enables users to post reviews and get paid or given bonuses in return. For instance, a person might visit the review site, post a review on the coffee shop page, and earn rewards for doing so. Then, a person can use these benefits too, say, purchase coffee at this actual coffee business.</p>\r\n\r\n<h6>The Complete Development Cycle for a Review Website</h6>\r\n<p>Now that you are aware of the benefits and cons associated with review apps and websites, let\'s talk about how to make an app similar to Yelp.</p>\r\n \r\n<p><bold>What would you need to build a top-notch review platform—both in terms of what and who—? Continue reading to discover the essential phases of the development process.</bold></p>\r\n\r\n<h6>Planning</h6>\r\n<p>A crucial phase is the planning phase. At this point, you ought to select a spending limit. How much money are you willing to spend on developing a Yelp-like app? We suggest that you first research the market and potential costs associated with developing such applications.</p>\r\n \r\n<p>The resources required to create the application are another consideration. In this situation, a team that will work on all phases of application creation is your key resource.</p>\r\n \r\n<p>It is necessary to arrange deadlines. Decide on a rough deadline for when you want the product\'s development to be finished. As a result, it will be simpler for you to manage the execution of each stage, and the process of producing a product won\'t take as long.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Finally, clearly express your proposal. Since your development team will undoubtedly be baffled if you don\'t know exactly what you want to create, you won\'t undoubtedly achieve the ideal outcome.</p>\r\n\r\n<h6>Analyses and Product Development</h6>\r\n<p>At this point, you must conduct in-depth market research and define the following:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Your corporate targets </li>\r\n<li>Your system for making money </li>\r\n<li>Your principal rivals </li>\r\n<li>Target market</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>In this step, you complete your review platform\'s overarching goal and vision, list its key benefits, and decide on the market niche you want to target.</p>\r\n\r\n<h6>Designing UX/UI</h6>\r\n<p>Get creative now! For both a website and a mobile app (if you\'re planning to make one), it\'s best to generate numerous mockups. Include the branding elements, such as the color scheme, logo, icons, and any desired images or videos.</p>\r\n \r\n<p>Keep in mind that your branding will be consistent across all of the social channels, newsletters, pages, and subproducts you\'re planning to release. Keep the creatives and styles uniform throughout.</p>\r\n \r\n<p>Creating the ideal logo and creatives for your platform could take some time. However, if you are successful, effective branding will undoubtedly raise brand awareness and contribute to greater client trust.</p>\r\n<p>You\'ll also need to construct a wireframe and a sitemap. You may envision what you\'ve prepared on paper with the aid of these two components. An interesting tidbit</p>\r\n \r\n<p>You may view all of the pages on a website, as well as how they are arranged and related to one another, with the use of a sitemap. Additionally, it aids in correctly arranging the functioning of the website and its content.</p>\r\n \r\n<p>The layout of each page of your website is depicted in a wireframe. The CTAs, headlines, pop-up notifications, and subscription boxes are all ignored along with the entire content. Typically, the wireframe is created for both the desktop and mobile versions.</p>\r\n\r\n<h6>Generation of content</h6>\r\n<p>Let\'s give your product some appropriate terminology now that you are aware of how it will appear. Consider all the texts you\'ll be sending and receiving for each page of your site.</p>\r\n \r\n<p>To improve your review website\'s Google ranking and draw in more visitors, you\'ll need to write optimized texts, descriptions, headings, and slogans for every page.</p>\r\n \r\n<p>Therefore, you\'ll need to collaborate closely with your marketing and content teams to set up the ideal blog posts, landing pages, testimonials, etc. that are correctly formatted and optimized. There should be everything you deem required for a good review platform.</p>\r\n<h6>Development</h6>\r\n<p>It\'s time to finish the designs and content for your rock star project. At this point, the development team works on creating an actual, functional website out of all the photos and creatives while also adding any necessary features for your service.</p>\r\n \r\n<p>You\'ll need a comfortable comment area with the ability to submit images or videos and rate particular criteria if you wish to create a review website. You\'ll also need to provide a brief feedback feature for a place or store a user has visited on such a platform. This can be accomplished by including a like/dislike button or by including a few emoticons so that users can express their experiences in a lighthearted manner.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Additionally, the team should incorporate Google Maps or any other web services if your review platform is going to provide information about the location (address, contacts, etc.) so that users can quickly discover the opening times, location, and price range (if applicable).</p>\r\n\r\n<h6>Integrating and testing</h6>\r\n<p>To ensure the platform is ready to use, check everything again, including all the links, page speed, content, UI, and UX. It\'s crucial to involve all the departments in the search for any potential bugs, grammatical errors, broken links, and other minor problems that can have an impact on the platform launch.</p>\r\n \r\n<p>Make sure your website and mobile app are compatible with all the platforms you intended to use if you produced both. Verify that all of the buttons are functional, the comment area is functioning properly, and the web and mobile platforms are both well-optimized and have a fast load time.</p>\r\n<h6>Maintenance</h6>\r\n<p>You succeeded! Your website is now active. Next, what?</p>\r\n \r\n<p>Your labor isn\'t done after the website is launched. You should continually assess how it functions, checking to make sure all errors are repaired and the material is timely updated.</p>\r\n \r\n<p>You should also take the following actions to maintain your review platform:</p>\r\n<ul> <li>\r\n<li>Update old material and add new ones. </li>\r\n<li>Check the volume of traffic to your website and make sure it loads as quickly as feasible. </li>\r\n<li>Make the graphic content more effective to prevent it from hindering the speed of the website. </li>\r\n<li>Verify that all the buttons and links function properly.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h6>How Much Does it Cost to Develop Yelp-like Apps?</h6>\r\n<p>Typically, it\'s challenging to pinpoint the precise figure for each comparable review platform. It relies on a lot of variables, including the deadlines and the necessary quantity of features. Additionally, it is based on the hourly wages of the employees, understaffed workers, or independent contractors who are developing the app. Starting at $15 to $25 per hour, this fee can go as high as $150.</p>\r\n \r\n<p>However, if we use a development timeframe breakdown and an average fee of, say, $50/hour, we may obtain an idea of how much it would cost to construct an app similar to Yelp.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Remember that the hourly wage can change based on the firm size and the experience level of the employee. If you\'re still unsure of how much money you should budget, you can always request a brief consultation with an expert company, which can assist you in making all the calculations and offering more precise time frames. Typically, the price of a Yelp-like app ranges from $30000 to $150000.</p>\r\n \r\n<h6>Considering the period of development. What is the potential length of a project?</h6>\r\n\r\nThe Time It Takes to Create a Review App, on Average\r\n<p>Additionally, it relies on the team you\'re assembling and the level of knowledge they possess. When working on multiple projects at once, freelancers may complete their work more slowly than your full-time staff members.</p>\r\n \r\n<p>You may always hire a digital agency to help you out and discover the high-performing team members to give the best outcomes catered to your business demands if you are short on developers or project managers.</p>\r\n \r\n<p>Considering all of these details, the following is an example of the typical timeframe breakdown for each of the most crucial app development steps:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Creating an app takes around. </li>\r\n<li>Development: about 250-850 hours</li>\r\n<li>QA: about 250 hours</li>\r\n<li>Project management: about 200–300 hours </li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>Additionally, don\'t forget to factor in the planning and analysis phases as well as the first upkeep.</p>\r\n\r\n<h6>Our Specialty</h6>\r\n<p>We at DotOxygen have a tonne of expertise building platforms like Yelp. One of our partners, Needl, required a platform upgrade because the platform was out of step with the new positioning of the Needl product.

There are further benefits to outsourcing a dedicated software team to Ukraine, such as a time zone that partially aligns with those of the US and the UK and a workplace environment where competition and competitiveness are appreciated. Additionally, the pricing and quality are perfectly in line in Ukraine.</p>\r\n \r\n<h6>Team Committed to Software Development: Examples of Collaboration</h6>\r\n \r\n<p>There are generally three ways to work with a focused software development team:</p>\r\n<h6>Full-service</h6>\r\n<p>In this approach, your business receives a specialized development team that will offer you all the services you require, including analysis, management, design, development, etc.</p>\r\n \r\n<p>You won\'t need to look for any more experts. All the specialists and experts you require for your project will be on the committed team.</p>\r\n \r\n<h6>On-demand</h6>\r\n<p>This strategy allows you to employ a unique specialist or specialists for particular tasks. Let\'s assume that all your application needs are a design. Then you require an on-demand committed team.<p>\r\n \r\n<h6>Maintenance</h6>\r\n<p>A standalone sprint team is the committed maintenance team. A project manager, lead engineer, front-end and back-end developers, quality analysts, and support personnel are on each team. This team\'s objective is to provide product support.</p>\r\n\r\n<h6>How Does a Devoted Software Development Team Function in Practice?</h6>\r\n \r\n<p>A good strategy for a young company\'s quick entry into the market is to hire a committed workforce from a strong, dynamically growing IT company that has completed projects successfully and demonstrated its competitiveness. Your ability to achieve a qualitatively new level and position yourself ahead of the competition will be aided by an experienced, committed team.</p>\r\n \r\n<p>How can one collaborate with a focused software team? The following is a list of actions to take:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Analysis of the issue. You should first decide why you require a specialized software development team, the issue you wish to address, and the desired outcome.</li>\r\n<li>Create documentation and describe requirements. So that there are no issues or misunderstandings in the future, everything that you expect from a committed team should be written.</li>\r\n<li>Assembling and employing a crew. Later, we\'ll go into greater detail about this.</li>\r\n<li>Establishing communication and a workflow. Effective teamwork and regular communication are necessary so that you can track the development of your job.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h5>How Can I Find a Committed Software Development Team?</h5>\r\n \r\n<p>For your convenience, our team has put together a brief, step-by-step hiring guide for a software development team.</p>\r\n \r\n <h6>1. Outline your requirements, budget, and goals.</h6>\r\n \r\n<p>Before bringing on a team to develop software: </p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Choose your ultimate objectives.</li>\r\n<li>For each of the procedures, a budget.</li>\r\n<li>Specify what you need.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>You may organize the employment process and the product development process from the beginning with the aid of these measures. You won\'t run into any problems with your committed team in the future if you are clear on what you want to achieve in the end.</p>\r\n\r\n<h6>2. Select a cooperative model</h6>\r\n<p>The next step is to choose a model of collaboration with a committed software development team. We have discussed various cooperative models and when it is preferable to use them.</p>\r\n \r\n \r\n<p>Consider whether a project requires a full team or if a few specialized team developers can handle a single task. If your product is already finished but you still want assistance, you might think about hiring a specialized maintenance crew.</p>\r\n \r\n<h6>3. Locate and speak with possible teams</h6>\r\n \r\n<p>You can now begin looking for a team. There are several areas where you can locate a superb, devoted workforce. You can hire a software development team by using social media sites like LinkedIn. Some businesses offer committed software development teams and their services.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>You can learn more about the team\'s experience, the skills of the dedicated team developers, the projects the team worked on, the outcomes their clients experienced, etc. by looking at their profiles.</p>\r\n \r\n<p>Additionally, you can locate a committed group on review websites like Clutch. co. There, you can read client testimonials and find out more about the tasks the team undertook. Among other things, you can contrast groups and businesses based on their ratings.</p>\r\n \r\n<p>Asking your friends or coworkers for recommendations is another technique to find a software development team. They could be able to recommend some excellent dedicated team developers if they had prior success with a dedicated software development team.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>You can begin interviewing possible teams after you have a list of them. To determine precisely whether this or that team is appropriate for your project, ask as many questions as you can.</p>\r\n \r\n<h6>4. Start a dedicated software development team.</h6>\r\n \r\n<p>You can begin once you have chosen the ideal committed team for your project. Communication is the first thing you and your committed software development team need to coordinate. It ought to be normal.</p>\r\n \r\n \r\n \r\n<p>This is required to keep track of and manage how each process is developing. When you get in touch to discuss significant concerns and approve tasks, agree with the team.</p>\r\n\r\n<h6>5. Establish KPIs</h6>\r\n<p>Establishing KPIs is an important step. Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) enable you to assess how well, quickly, and efficiently an employee is performing. The achievement of the company\'s team goals is dependent on these indicators.</p>\r\n \r\n \r\n<p>It is critical to select and calculate which KPIs will adequately assess the effectiveness of a specific member of a dedicated team.</p>\r\n \r\n<p>The benefits of the KPI tool\'s capabilities for members of a dedicated software development team are obvious - you don\'t have to monitor how the managers work hourly. It is sufficient to calculate the KPI at the beginning and end of the month to control the KPI.</p>\r\n\r\n<h5>Top Hiring Mistakes - Dedicated Software Development Team</h5>\r\n \r\n \r\n<p>Candidates for product teams typically have much higher requirements than members of component teams or traditional project teams. This is due to the product\'s level of responsibility. The DotOxygen team is eager to share its knowledge and inform you of the most common mistakes that result in the hiring of unsuitable candidates.</p>\r\n \r\n<h6>Relevant work experience</h6>\r\n<p>Each member of the team should have relevant experience. This is also true for the developer, designer, or manager. A candidate with a few years of experience but little knowledge in your field may not be the best fit for your team. Calculation at the beginning and end of the month - to control the KPI</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Another requirement would apply to developers, QA engineers, or designers. It is also possible that the candidate has the necessary experience but is using outdated technology that is no longer applicable to a specific product. This will also not benefit the product.</p>\r\n \r\n<h6>Only specialists who are required</h6>\r\n \r\n<p>Furthermore, a dedicated software development team comprised of all necessary specialists should be formed. Delegating responsibilities and combining tasks will only exacerbate the project\'s problems.</p>\r\n<h6>Correct organization</h6>\r\n \r\n<p>Having all of the necessary skills to create a product is insufficient. Each member should have good relationships, and the association should be consistent:</p>\r\n \r\n \r\n \r\n<h6>Team members share the same vision and strive for the same outcomes.</h6>\r\n \r\n \r\n \r\n<p>Each team member has a good relationship and understanding of one another.</p>\r\n \r\n<h6>Team Communication and Participation</h6>\r\n<p>Tell your team all the details about your product if you want them to work in \"self-fulfillment\" mode. Find \"common ground\" with the team by explaining the importance and purpose of your product. Also, remember to communicate with your team in the future. Make time for each situation: hold daily meetings, discuss work issues with the team, and so on.</p>\r\n \r\n \r\n<h6>The financial problem</h6>\r\n \r\n<p>Companies frequently hire specialists whose services are the least expensive in order to save money. But this is fundamentally incorrect. Choose specialists whose skills are optimal for the project and meet the specialist\'s salary expectations. And always provide good monetary and socio-labor conditions to previously selected specialists.</p>\r\n\r\n<h6>Isolation of the team</h6>\r\n<p>Allows your employees to freely communicate with one another. Teamwork allows each member to highlight and develop their strengths while compensating for their weaknesses. The employee will be effective in their field and will be able to assist others in their advancement. Furthermore, he will be able to improve and learn skills that he currently lacks.</p>\r\n \r\n \r\n<h6>How Should a Dedicated Software Development Team Be Managed?</h6>\r\n \r\n<p>And now that we\'ve discussed effective management, let\'s take a closer look at this question.</p>\r\n \r\n \r\n \r\n<h6>One piece of software for both work and communication</h6>\r\n \r\n<p>Your team requires software that makes it simple to collaborate and organize. The software development project management tool enables the team to see how individual tasks contribute to the overall goal of the project.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Managers organize, assign, schedule, and prioritize the various tasks that comprise a project. Team members can view assignments while using various display filters at the same time. Task managers like Jira or Asana, for example, can assist your team with such tasks.</p>\r\n \r\n<p>Project management software also makes it simple for your team to collaborate and communicate. Team members can monitor conversations and alert each other when tasks are ready for handover whether they work in person or remotely.</p>\r\n \r\n<h6>Engage in active communication.</h6>\r\n \r\n<p>While virtual communication is now very convenient, it is not a complete replacement for team communication. Employees expect leaders to demonstrate genuine concern for individual and team well-being.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Many employees look forward to weekly one-on-one meetings. It\'s sufficient to keep questions and concerns at bay, but not so frequent that it appears to be micromanagement. Ask questions about individual and group challenges, barriers, and suggestions for improvement during these sessions. Work as hard to establish trust as you do to demonstrate empathy and listening.</p>\r\n \r\n<h6>Clearly state your objectives.</h6>\r\n \r\n<p>Make sure your team understands your expectations and that your project goal is clearly stated. All of them should be in line with your company\'s objectives. Your development partner should understand and consider the target market, expected profits, growth rates, and so on. Long-term and short-term goals should be defined to ensure a timely launch, sustained growth, and long-term success.</p>\r\n\r\n<h6>Create a clear organizational structure.</h6>\r\n<p>Each employee should have specific job objectives and a method of operation. Leading a team necessitates organizational skills. To put operational management into action, you must first define the method and distribution of work.</p>\r\n \r\n \r\n<p>Understand each employee\'s organization in order to coordinate staff through strategic and agile management. It is a good idea to direct the weekly work meeting to establish clear goals that must be met.</p>\r\n \r\n<h6>Keep an eye on workloads.</h6>\r\n \r\n<p>One of the reasons why software development projects fail is insufficient team size. When teams are too small, workloads become excessive, and engineers are at risk of burnout. Adding an excessive number of developers to a project wastes resources and raises costs.</p>\r\n\r\nAverage Hourly Rate\r\n\r\n<table class=\"table\">\r\n    <thead>\r\n      <tr>\r\n        <th></th>\r\n        <th></th>\r\n        <th>Average Hourly Rate</th>\r\n        <th></th>\r\n        <th></th>\r\n      </tr>\r\n    </thead>\r\n    <tbody>\r\n      <tr>\r\n        <td>Region</td>\r\n        <td>Project Manager</td>\r\n        <td>Designer</td>\r\n        <td>Frontend Developer</td>\r\n        <td>Backend Developer</td>\r\n      </tr>\r\n      <tr>\r\n        <td>Eastern Europe</td>\r\n        <td>$20-40/hr</td>\r\n        <td>$35-60/hr</td>\r\n        <td>$30-80/hr</td>\r\n        <td>$40-90/hr</td>\r\n      </tr>\r\n      <tr>\r\n        <td>Western Europe</td>\r\n        <td>$30-70/hr</td>\r\n        <td>$45-100/hr</td>\r\n        <td>$55-100/hr</td>\r\n        <td>$65-105/hr</td>\r\n      </tr>\r\n      <tr>\r\n        <td>America</td>\r\n        <td><40/hr</td>\r\n        <td><$45/hr</td>\r\n        <td>$25-55/hr</td>\r\n        <td>$35-65/hr</td>\r\n      </tr>\r\n      <tr>\r\n        <td>Asia</td>\r\n        <td><35/hr</td>\r\n        <td><$40/hr</td>\r\n        <td><$45/hr</td>\r\n        <td><$55/hr</td>\r\n      </tr>\r\n    </tbody>\r\n  </table>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<h5>Summary of the Dedicated Software Development Team</h5>\r\n<p>In a crisis, with temporary financial issues or the need for project experts, it is far more profitable to engage a software development team on a temporary basis than to create new employment, search for talent, form a new team, and create a positive microclimate within it.</p>\r\n \r\n<p>Creating a team from scratch delays the start of the project and incurs additional financial costs.</p>\r\n \r\n \r\n<p>Do you have ideas and are you willing to hire a dedicated team to put them into action?

(97, 12, 'DotOxygen', '20.06.2022', 'How to Make a Website Like Shutterstock in 2022', '<p>How can a website like Shutterstock be created? You must first decide what you must deal with from the perspectives of the client, developer, and service provider to build a respectable and competitive application in the style of Shutterstock.</p>\r\n \r\n<p>It\'s challenging to compete with Shutterstock, and there is no straightforward way to launch a stock photo website. Since its founding in 2003, this company has made significant contributions to its success. The conclusion is clear: while considering the current rate of development and the general evolution of technologies, it is crucial to assess all of the company\'s flaws and replicate its successes, both technological and tactical.</p>\r\n<p>The most important thing is to realize that not everything can be implemented right away while building a stock photo website. For a very long time, this platform recovered from its low points. Along the way, there have also been both acquisitions of smaller businesses and a regular flow of investments.</p>\r\n \r\n<p>In the context of the inquiry \"how to launch a stock photo website,\" it is challenging to rely on this. However, there is no reason to question the project\'s success. However, we can also forecast the timing and volume of investment.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The final item to comprehend is that we will start badly while building a stock photo website that resembles the original. The key ideas should be reiterated, but there will be a lot of new information that has to be included.</p>\r\n\r\n<h5>What is a Website with Stock Photos Like Shutterstock?</h5>\r\n<p>A business that offers a large selection of stock photographs and images that are free from copyright limitations is called Shutterstock. The Creative Commons (CC0) license, which grants you unrestricted editing, copying, and utilizing rights, is what we\'ve come to know as this feature. And as you begin to build a stock photo website, bear it in mind.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Arizton projects that the size of the worldwide stock picture market will reach $4.43 billion by 2025, expanding at a CAGR of 5% from 2021 to 2025.</p>\r\n \r\n<p>The expansion of the Internet on a global scale has led to illegal photo downloads. By choosing images with Creative Commons licenses that permit you to use them without charging a fee, Bing and Google make it simple to find free images. And that\'s what led to a decrease in the cost of stock photographs.</p>\r\n \r\n<p>The industry\'s lifeblood, professional photographers, is currently refusing to provide them. However, since images are so important to consumer lives and since communication and commerce are essential to the functioning of the world, there will always be a demand for stock photos.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The evolving media environment, evolving client perspectives, and changing agency business models are all affecting market expansion.</p>\r\n \r\n<p>The growth of digital communities, the rise in animation productions, the spread of social commerce with buy possibilities, and the improvement of audio video are only a few of the market\'s drivers, trends, and limits.</p>\r\n \r\n<p>The stock photo and video industry have been hardest hit by the pandemic\'s effects. More so because it falls under marketing and departmental budget cuts start at the beginning of each crisis. However, since video production has stopped and studio shoots have been postponed, the market has benefited.</p>\r\n\r\n<h5>DotOxygen Website Development Experience with Stock Photos</h5>\r\n<p>You can draw on our expertise if you\'re trying to figure out how to create a website similar to Shutterstock.

We are happy to work with you to develop a fantastic solution.</p>\r\n\r\n<h6>Product Research</h6>\r\n<p>multiple closely connected sub-processes make up the Product Discovery business process. Finding product/market fit and validating the business model with a functioning product are the objectives of this stage. Continually lowering risks through the validation of consumer behavior, value proposition, product solution, business strategy, and acquisition channels is the key to achieving this.</p>\r\n \r\n<h6>To discover a product successfully, follow these steps:</h6>\r\n \r\n<p>Respond to the \"Why?\" inquiry. Recognize the product\'s purpose. Along with the product\'s actual vision, consider how it aligns with the objectives of the business. This \"why\" will serve as motivation later, so make sure everyone is on board with it at the outset.</p>\r\n\r\n<h6>Consider metrics.</h6>\r\n<p>Knowing how you will gauge the success of your product will offer you a clear objective to work toward rather than chasing after a hazy \"why.\" How many paying users are necessary to promote long-term growth? Decide what the breakpoints should represent on the timeline after setting a timetable to help you understand when and where you want to go.</p>\r\n\r\n \r\n<h6>Set limitations. </h6>\r\n<p>Sit down and discuss restrictions with professionals from various industries (designers, developers, marketers, etc.). Knowing what they will be working with is helpful when choosing a launch date for a product or allocating resources.</p>\r\n\r\n<h6>Choose the risks. </h6>\r\n<p>Nobody wants a crisis, but if one does arise, the best course of action is to be prepared. Together, consider what could go wrong and how you can handle the circumstance. Some things are out of your control, such as another company releasing a product before you do or even a natural calamity!</p>\r\n \r\n<p>Learn about your users. It is conceivably the most crucial phase of the product discovery process.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For qualitative and quantitative findings, conduct bespoke research. user feedback. Asking people to respond to open-ended questions, which allow them to provide you with in-depth information to help you improve your product, is the ideal method to collect relevant feedback.</p>\r\n \r\n<h6>Design UX</h6>\r\n<p>Start developing UX design after that. How can a user-friendly website similar to Shutterstock be created? The importance of the user experience for any product was already mentioned. Here are the first six steps to good UX design:</p>\r\n \r\n<h6>Examine the users.</h6>\r\n <p>The first step is to identify the target audience for your designs. There are numerous ways to learn more about your users. Analyses of both quantitative and qualitative data and comments are combined. You can only make a successful design for your consumers if you comprehend their objectives, demands, and preferences.</p>\r\n\r\n<h6>Establish situations.</h6>\r\n <p>The next step is to be clear about what you (or rather, your users) are trying to accomplish based on your research. Make the ideal trip plan for your client and note any potential obstacles. Describe as many scenarios and applications for your product/service as you can.\r\n<h6>Create a concept.</h6>\r\n <p>Start brainstorming after gathering all the facts gathered. To visually communicate the issue, you are attempting to solve, create a storyboard or mood board.</p>\r\n \r\n<h6>Establish a prototype.</h6>\r\n <p>Even before the development stage, prototyping is the most efficient technique to make your concept come to life. Put a paper mock-up of the interface with all of its crucial elements down, and then request as many replays of the script as you can.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Try it. Tests are essential to UX design. It doesn\'t have to be a drawn-out, tiresome procedure. The Nielsen Norman Group claims that only 5 users can identify 85% of all faults on your website.</p>\r\n \r\n<p>As needed, repeat the instructions. You might need to return to the idea stage and find some other alternate options depending on the outcomes of your testing. The UX design process is iterative, meaning that some processes must be repeated to produce the intended outcome.</p>\r\n \r\n<h6>UX/UI Design</h6>\r\n<p>How can a website like Shutterstock be created so that users will find it visually appealing? The goal of the UI is to create a positive user experience. Every component that a user interacts with can be seen as part of the user interface.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><b>For instance:</b></p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>buttons</li>\r\n<li>text boxes</li>\r\n<li>checkboxes</li>\r\n<li>sliders</li>\r\n<li>search engine</li>\r\n<li>tags</li>\r\n<li>icons</li>\r\n </ul>\r\n<h6>Construction Cycle</h6>\r\n<p>A separate significant stage of converting the design into a functional product also starts. At this point, new features are developed and implemented progressively using a consistent and acknowledged development approach. At DotOxygen, we employ the SCRUM method of Agile methodology. Jira is also used by us to manage tasks.</p>\r\n<p>Let\'s examine each phase of the development cycle in further detail to help answer the query of how to launch a stock photo website:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In reality, there are 5 main stages to the product development process. All product components are coded by developers utilizing the architecture and documentation. The team members\' assignments are assigned to them based on their areas of expertise.</p>\r\n\r\n<h6>Technical Specifications for Products</h6>\r\n<p>To create a product that meets the client\'s expectations and needs, all pertinent information from the client is gathered during this phase. You ought to select technical stacks and develop technical documentation.</p>\r\n \r\n \r\n<p>At this point, the user roles (admin and super admin) and functionality needs (requirements for the admin panel) are established. It would be ideal to complete the scope of the task and the estimate.</p>\r\n \r\n<h6>Development<h6>\r\n \r\n<p>Developers working on the front end are in charge of the application\'s client side. The creation of APIs and databases is the responsibility of back-end developers. Every newly released feature is tested. The CI/CD process is handled by the DevOps team.</p>\r\n \r\n<p>The REST API is also created by the team. We at DotOxygen follow industry standards when developing the REST API, such as:</p>\r\n\r\nArchiving huge blocks of data, utilizing the secure HTTPS protocol, and employing as many HTTP codes as you can.\r\nTesting QA engineers run manual tests on every delivered code and test developing components.\r\n \r\n<h6>Installation & Integration<h6>\r\n<p>The team shifts to production deployment and integration when the QA team completes their development and regression testing. Users are given access to the product\'s tested version so they can do beta testing. The group gathers user input, resolves bugs, and makes minor adjustments.<p>\r\n \r\n<h6>Launch</h6>\r\n<p>The market should see your stuff right away! To ensure that customers would prefer the product, the product launch process must be meticulously planned out and executed methodically. The key steps to a successful product launch process are as follows:<p>\r\n <ul>\r\n<li>determining the target audience.</li>\r\n<li>production of distinctive product packaging.</li>\r\n<li>construction of a slogan and a timetable.</li>\r\n<li>competition research.</li>\r\n<li>establishment of customer onboarding.</li>\r\n<li>building a website.</li>\r\n<li>advertising.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h6>Scaling</h6>\r\n<p>The evolution of the stock photo website doesn\'t stop there. You will eventually need to develop and scale the product further, repair any bugs that may have appeared, and improve it.</p>\r\n \r\n<h6>Maintenance</h6>\r\n<p>If a problem arises that needs to be resolved or enhancements need to be made after deploying a product in the production environment.</p>\r\n\r\n<h6>Using a stock photo website\'s monetization plan</h6>\r\n<p>You must consider website monetization after it is complete. To make money off of your website selling stock photos, we advise choosing one of the following models:</p>\r\n \r\n<h6>Subscribe</h6>\r\n \r\n<p>A subscription is one of the most popular monetization strategies. It is the need that customers to purchase a subscription to download a set amount of pictures from your website. You can create several plans, each with a unique set of capabilities and, naturally, costs.</p>\r\n \r\n<h6>Pay for the item</h6>\r\n \r\n<p>The purchase of the item is the second method of monetization. Here, everything is easy. Only the photos that customers want to download are charged. All photographs might have the same price or be divided into multiple pricing categories.</p>\r\n\r\n<h6>What Is the Price of a Website Like Shutterstock?</h6>\r\n \r\n<p>How can a site like Shutterstock be created without making huge financial losses? The size, number, and specifics of your project will all affect how much it will cost to construct a stock photo website. To avoid wasting money on the wrong strategy and burning your money, all of this should be decided during the business analysis stage.</p>\r\n \r\n<p>When starting an online school, the following expense areas should be taken into account:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Item discovery</li>\r\n<li>UX and UI design</li>\r\n<li>Development</li>\r\n<li>QA (Testing)</li>\r\n </ul>\r\n<p>The cost will also depend on where your contractor is located. The top 4 geographic areas that provide qualified and experienced IT professionals have been determined. Let\'s take a look at the amount of money you will require for each level individually based on the nation.</p>\r\n\r\n<table class=\"table\">\r\n    <thead>\r\n      <tr>\r\n        <th>Region</th>\r\n        <th>Project Manager</th>\r\n        <th>Designer</th>\r\n        <th>Frontend Developer</th>\r\n        <th>Backend Developer</th>\r\n      </tr>\r\n    </thead>\r\n    <tbody>\r\n      <tr>\r\n        <td>Eastern Europe</td>\r\n        <td>$35-60/hr</td>\r\n        <td>$35-60/hr</td>\r\n        <td>$30-80/hr</td>\r\n        <td>$25-50/hr</td>\r\n      </tr>\r\n      <tr>\r\n        <td>Western Europe</td>\r\n        <td>$45-90/hr</td>\r\n        <td>$45-100/hr</td>\r\n        <td>$55-100/hr</td>\r\n        <td>$30-65/hr</td>\r\n      </tr>\r\n      <tr>\r\n        <td>America</td>\r\n        <td><$20-55/hr</td>\r\n        <td><$45/hr</td>\r\n        <td>$25-55/hr</td>\r\n        <td>$20-40/hr</td>\r\n      </tr>\r\n      <tr>\r\n        <td>Asia</td>\r\n        <td><$15-25/hr</td>\r\n        <td><$40/hr</td>\r\n        <td><$45/hr</td>\r\n        <td><$30/hr</td>\r\n      </tr>\r\n    </tbody>\r\n  </table>\r\n \r\n \r\n<h6>Let’s also take a look at the cost of a project depending on its size:</h6>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Small project: $25-35k</li>\r\n<li>Middle-sized project: $35-45k</li>\r\n<li>Enterprise project: $45k+</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h6>Summary</h6>\r\n \r\n<p>Visual content will continue to drive marketing and sales for years to come. The need for images, films, and graphics will consequently increase. Despite the intense competition in the microstock industry, it is still possible to make a stock photography company like Shutterstock stand out by coming up with some original, innovative ideas or by providing better service and products.</p>\r\n \r\n<p>Start by investigating the issues that are bothering your audience and coming up with solutions. Large and well-known photo agencies include Shutterstock, Getty Images, Dreamtime, and Fotolia. A new generation used to one-click activities and mobility will easily adapt to simplified apps. So, start with a few distinctive features and then gradually broaden.</p>\r\n\r\n', '759129-how_to_make_a_website_like_shutter_stock_in_2022.jpg', 'Branding, Website Design, Website Development, User Interface, User Experience', '2020-06-20 21:00:00.00000', '20.06.2022'),

Readers seldom have access to information on internal knowledge and procedures.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As a result, we\'ve chosen to offer a portion of our design process to assist agencies and design teams throughout the world in developing effective interfaces and apps.</p>\r\n\r\n<h5>What are the best tools to use?</h5>\r\n\r\n<p>The most often used DotOxygen tools</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We utilize Dropbox Files and Paper, but you can also use Google Docs with Google Drive or Office 365 Word with Microsoft OneDrive. The aim is to locate cloud file storage that works well with desktop sync and has a collaborative text/notes editing interface.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The majority of our work is done with traditional files in the following formats:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>graphic (Sketch, Figma, Photoshop, Illustrator)</li>\r\n<li>video (After Effects)</li>\r\n<li>3D (Cinema 4D)</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h6>Research</h6>\r\n<p>We gather information on the present or proposed system, as well as references to rivals, throughout the research stage: samples, screenshots, screencasts, interview recordings, and any other work materials. We use Dropbox Paper or Google Drive to keep our research materials.\r\nIf the effort is coming in daily, so should the outcomes. That\'s why we keep daily design outcomes in a folder labelled \"2022-06-20\" and named after the date. The daily research information may then be simply combined into a presentation for the art director in this manner.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<h6>Wireframes</h6>\r\n<p>Wireframes are an essential aspect of what we do. They enable us to quickly create all critical usage scenarios, discover the fundamental principles of human interaction with a product, and undertake usability testing.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We produce high-fidelity wireframes so that developers may utilize them even if the mockup doesn\'t have any style. During this stage, the majority of the UX design takes place.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>To demonstrate navigation and screen flows, we use InVision to create wireframes. We also create user journeys to account for all situations and edge circumstances. User flows help us comprehend what has been done and what has not been done; they also provide a useful framework for developers.</p>\r\n\r\n<h6>Designs</h6>\r\n<p>This is also known as the Visual Design section. The Designs folder contains all of the final designs. In the Research, Wireframes, and Outgoing folders, the normal subfolder structure is the same.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<h6>Development</h6>\r\n<p>We keep the files developers need, such as wireframes, designs, graphics, and typefaces, in this folder. Zeplin also provides final designs to developers. We\'ll be able to regulate exactly what gets into development this way.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We may replace this folder or add additional specialized portions necessary during the process, depending on the project.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As a result, development begins in earnest, under the requirements, to ensure that the product is delivered on time.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<h6>File Naming</h6>\r\n<p>Naming conventions for exported files</p>\r\n<p>A well-organized procedure requires a consistent file naming convention. It\'s critical to be able to locate and differentiate the file you want easily and worldwide (for example, within a search among all of your projects).</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>The following template is used to name the final design file:</p>\r\n\r\n<h6>FlowNumber-StepNumber-StateNumber-AdditionlStateNumber(Optional)-Name</h6>\r\n<p>Each product\'s flow step is assigned a number. For example, we consider the Login page to be an important part of the product flow. Because login is frequently the first and most common stage in the product flow, it is given the number 00.</p>\r\n<p>The numbers begin at zero. The addition of a zero before the single-digit aids with file organization. If there are more than 99 flows, use three digits. Note: We\'ve never gotten to 99 in our 15 years of working on the most challenging projects.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A number is assigned to each step in the product flow. On the login page, for example, there is a login dialogue with email and password entries and a Login button. The number 01 would be allocated to this flow step, while flow step 02 would be assigned to a password reset dialogue within a Login flow with a number 00.</p>\r\n<p>Every step has a state that is assigned a number. In the log-in dialogue, for example, we have a password entry field. The number 02 is set to such a stage since it occurs immediately after the email entry. We also give each state a name. As a result, the example\'s final name would be:</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>The design file for such a case would be designated if a user was locked out after multiple failed login attempts.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Choose state names that are easy to remember, such as Feed, Post, Filter, and Event. CamelCase is used to replace spaces in names like NewMessage and FollowGroup. Avoid names that are long and ambiguous. You may add a letter at the end of the number chain if you wish to display many graphic options on the same screen.</p>\r\n\r\n<h6>Naming folders</h6>\r\n<p>We keep large groupings of files in folders that have the same naming convention.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>The final files are organized into folders for each stage of the process.</p>\r\n\r\n<h6>The naming of the source files</h6>\r\n<p>We use the same technique for naming source files, but we put a project name in front:</p>\r\n\r\n<p><b>ProjectName-FlowNumber-StepNumber-StateNumber—Name</b></p>\r\n<p>Because we can usually put all of the states in one file, the source will be called after it.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n', '902721-how_to_organize_files_in_a_design_development_agency.jpg', 'Branding, Website Design, Website Development, User Interface, User Experience', '2025-08-20 21:00:00.00000', '25.08.2022');

(99, 14, 'DotOxygen', '30.07.2022', 'How to Outsource Product Development', '<h5>What is the definition of Outsourced Product Development? [OPD]</h5>\r\n<p>Product outsourcing is the execution of software development projects, as well as their support, testing, and maintenance, by a special team assigned by an external service provider. Outsourcing product development is becoming increasingly popular. The success of outsourced product development is dependent on proper planning, the project team, communication between the outsourcing team and the customer, proper management, and so on.</p>\r\n\r\n<h6>Trends in Product Design Outsourcing</h6>\r\n<p>The global IT outsourcing market will be worth $425.19 billion by 2026, according to GlobeNewswire. IT product outsourcing is one of the areas most impacted by business process outsourcing, according to a Deloitte Global Outsourcing Survey. 57 percent of businesses say that outsourcing enables them to concentrate on their main company operations.</p>\r\n \r\n \r\n<p>With its epidemic, restrictions, and remote jobs, the year 2020 has changed the landscape of product development. As office-based work has become a home office, businesses have been compelled to transition to remote working and rely more and more on digital technologies.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The State of CEE IT Outsourcing and Offshoring 2021 Report states that time and money savings, access to expertise not accessible internally, the ability to innovate, flexibility, and degree of the organization are the primary drivers of product design outsourcing.</p>\r\n \r\n<h6>Main advantages of outsourcing product development</h6>\r\n<p>Outsourced product development offers clients of the organizations in the profile numerous important advantages, such as</p>\r\n <ul>\r\n<li>Access to cutting-edge resources, technologies, and talent.</li>\r\n<li>Cost-saving improvements to IT processes, precise timing, and accurate forecasts.</li>\r\n </ul>\r\n<h6>Outsourced and Internal Teams for Product Development</h6>\r\n<p>Contrary to product outsourcing development, in-house development enables you to build your team from the bottom up. Jobs will be filled based on the skills and knowledge needed to develop the product.</p>\r\n \r\n<p>The decision to use in-house development is comparable to hiring full-time personnel for your company. You\'ll need to go through hiring, interviews, and onboarding to build your own IT crew.</p>\r\n \r\n<p>The following are some benefits and drawbacks of hiring an internal product development team:</p>\r\n \r\n<p><b>Pros</b></p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>constant direct communication with a team</li>\r\n<li>quick assistance</li>\r\n<li>the internal team is in line with the objectives and culture of your business.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p><b>Cons</b></p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Costly</li>\r\n<li>High turnover rate</li>\r\n<li>Lacking experience, and in-house teams.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>Read our post In-house vs. Outsourcing: Detailed Comparison in 2021 to decide which option is best for your project.</p>\r\n \r\n<h5>How can outsourced product development be made to be extremely profitable?</h5>\r\n \r\n \r\n<p>Sometimes it can be difficult for a prospective client to begin working with a new business, especially if it is their first time or they have had a bad experience in the past. However, for this process to be effective, based on our expertise, we have created a list of the key considerations when outsourcing product development.</p>\r\n\r\n<h5>Who does the work for you?</h5>\r\n<p>The success of your project depends on your choice of a product development contractor, so make sure to choose it carefully. You must choose a contractor based on the following factors for outsourced product development to be very beneficial for your business:</p>\r\n <ul>\r\n<li>Location of the contractor. </li>\r\n<p>Eastern Europe is one of the greatest regions for outsourcing, as experience has shown. There are many skilled professionals in this area, and services are reasonably priced. The work\'s quality is also considered to be quite excellent. Furthermore, you won\'t encounter any linguistic or cultural hurdles when working with an Eastern European contractor.</>\r\n\r\n<li>Experience. </li>\r\n<p>It\'s crucial to inquire about a contractor\'s work history, including how long the team has been in the business, how many projects it has completed, what major projects it has worked on, etc. before hiring them.</p>\r\n<li>Knowledge and Abilities. </li>\r\n<p>The abilities and skills of the contractor\'s team must also be evaluated. Why do you need individuals that can\'t handle your project? Examine the team\'s portfolio, go over client testimonials, discover the team\'s strengths and limitations, etc.</p>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h5>What kind of labor is required?</h5>\r\n<p>Before outsourcing your product, the second crucial step is to assess the type and volume of work that has to be done. If you are unsure of what must be done.</p>\r\n<p>Decide whether you must design the entire user interface and user experience of a product, or whether you can tackle just a portion of it. Effective planning is the secret to success!</p>\r\n \r\n<h5>Which form of collaboration did you opt for?</h5>\r\n \r\n<p>Next, choose the model of cooperation you will use to collaborate with the contractor during the outsourcing of product design. The most well-liked models include Fixed Price and Time and Materials.</p>\r\n \r\n<p>The Fixed Price approach assumes that the overall project budget is agreed upon before work begins and stays the same. Additionally, the precise completion date for the project is approved before construction begins.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The risks of performing the work late fall on the contractor. On the one hand, this model may appear handy for you as the client because you are aware of the actual cost and delivery date of the project.</p>\r\n \r\n<p>If you look closer, the project will be delivered on schedule, but the cost and quality are in question. The contractor will be concerned with completing the job on schedule to avoid penalties, sometimes even at the expense of quality. As for the cost of the task, Fixed Price performers must budget for additional expenses to protect themselves against unforeseen circumstances.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Payment is based on work completion, according to the T&M contract. The company is focused on providing you with a quality solution in the quickest period feasible while working together on the Time and Material model for product outsourcing. This, in turn, ensures future successful collaboration.</p>\r\n \r\n<p>The T&M model\'s drawbacks include the requirement for additional communication with the business. When going over the specifics, however, you always know where your project is and how it is progressing, so you may make adjustments or enhancements while the work is still being done.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>They picked us to be their outsourcing provider. Due to the tight timelines for each assignment, we were forced to change the product\'s visual aspect to save practically everything.</p>\r\n \r\n<p>There were four primary sections to our effort on this project:</p>\r\n <ul>\r\n<li>Discovery - Of business and user objectives, stakeholder and user interviews, market research, personas, and CMJ</li>\r\n<li>Information structuring</li>\r\n<li>Detailed Instructions for Outsourced Product Development</li>\r\n </ul>\r\n <p>As we\'ve already mentioned, a successful product design outsourcing process requires careful planning. We have put up a guide to assist you in finding a trustworthy contractor and comprehending the key phases of this procedure.</p>\r\n \r\n<h6>Analyze your issues and demands about outsourced product development.</h6>\r\n \r\n<p>Analyzing your issues and needs is the first step you must take for outsourcing product design to be successful. Nothing will happen unless your request is properly stated and the contractor\'s team is aware of your unique needs. Make a list of the tasks you need to complete, decide on your budget, establish rough completion dates, etc.</p>\r\n\r\n<h6>Outsourced Product Development: Select a Collaborative Model</h6>\r\n<p>Next, pick a collaboration strategy that works for your project. The most common models of cooperation have already been discussed. Let\'s now examine the projects that each model is appropriate for.</p>\r\n \r\n<p>The Fixed Price model is most frequently used for modest projects with minimal functionality that will not be altered or enhanced.</p>\r\n \r\n<p><b>The Fixed Price model\'s main attributes are:</b></p>\r\n \r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Fixed costs</li>\r\n<li>A set scope of work</li>\r\n<li>Set deadlines</li>\r\n<li>The inability to add or change anything after the contract is signed</li>\r\n<li>Faster development times</li>\r\n<li>Potential product quality trade-offs.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p><b>The Time & Material model\'s main characteristics are:</b><p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>It is a flexible payment scheme that complies exactly with agile concepts</li>\r\n<li>The opportunity to swiftly begin development - in contrast to Fixed Price, working on T&M can begin practically immediately</li>\r\n<li>Transparent hourly developer fees give the client control over projects, budgets, and deadlines</li>\r\n<li>The capacity to observe work results at each stage</li>\r\n<li>You receive a resolution that lives up to your demands.</li>\r\n </ul>\r\n<h6>Choosing an Agency or Freelancer for Outsourced Product Development</h6>\r\n \r\n<p>You must first consider who you specifically need. You can require just one individual for a modest project or an entire team for a big, complicated one. Many things rely on this. We suggest reading Design Cycle: How It Works in Real Life.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Many business owners struggle with not knowing where to go for contractors when they are looking for and selecting an agency or freelancer to handle their outsourced product development. Here are some of the most well-known locations where you can locate a competent and trustworthy contractor:</p>\r\n \r\n<h6>Using social media</h6>\r\n \r\n<p>You can identify businesses or independent contractors on social media sites like LinkedIn, with whom you can collaborate productively. You can find examples of the team\'s work, customer reviews from prior clients, team ratings, and more on social media.<p>\r\n \r\n<h6>Mates and companions </h6>\r\n \r\n<p>Ask your friends, coworkers, or partners if they have any recommendations for reputable agencies or freelancers.</p>\r\n\r\n<h6>Sites that rank profiles</h6>\r\n \r\n<p>You may locate numerous product development firms, assess their portfolios, compare ratings, read reviews, etc.</p>\r\n \r\n \r\n \r\n<p>The DotOxygen team has extensive experience in both web development and product design. As a result, we would be pleased to assist you if you need assistance with a specific process or an entire project. Contact us without delay.</p>\r\n \r\n<h6>Write Design & Software Specifications for Outsourced Product Development</h6>\r\n \r\n<p>A design & software specification is a written description of your product that outlines the functions you want it to carry out as well as the user interface.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the process of outsourcing product design, this document is crucial. Writing everything down, even though it may seem tedious, is the most important thing you can do during the initial stages of product design and development. This is because your product\'s whole development process is guided by the design specifications.</p>\r\n \r\n<p>The following are typically included in the design and software requirements (specifications) document:</p>\r\n <ul>\r\n<li>Complete project overview</li>\r\n<li>Primary objectives; target audience</li>\r\n<li>Aesthetic elements, non-functional details, and the required set of functional features</li>\r\n<li>Prohibitions and recommendations</li>\r\n<li>Questions</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>To keep the product development process more organized, establish clear deadlines. Regularly check for modifications to the product or specific procedures.</p>\r\n \r\n\r\n<h5>Common Errors in Outsourced Product Development</h5>\r\n \r\n<p>Businesses that choose to outsource product development frequently commit several errors. The principal ones are listed below:</p>\r\n <ul>\r\n<li><h6>Contracting choice</h6></li>\r\n \r\n<p>Some businesses pay insufficient attention to selecting qualified contractors and opt to hire the first one they encounter. However, the success of your product is directly impacted by the contractor and product development team you choose.</p>\r\n \r\n<p>Spend some time organizing the hiring and search processes. The likelihood of choosing a trustworthy and accountable partner increases when you conduct a more thorough analysis of the contractors.</p>\r\n\r\n<li><h6>Issues with Communication</h6></li>\r\n<p>Probably the most frequent issue businesses that choose product outsourcing encounter is communication. Since the team that develops your product frequently works remotely, it is crucial to properly set up the communication process. As soon as you start working on your product, make plans for regular meetings and discussions about the status of the project.</p>\r\n\r\n \r\n<p>This will make it easier for you to monitor how the job is being done, how long each procedure lasts, and whether the team is carrying out the work.</p>\r\n\r\n<li><h6>Lack of planning</h6></li>\r\n<p>Failure of a project is caused by a lack of strategy. It is true! Without an early strategy and plan that you can follow, you will waste time and money. The keys to success, as we just discussed, are planning and preparation.</p>\r\n \r\n<li><h6>Inadequate team management</h6></li>\r\n<p>A company\'s ability to manage its operations well could make the difference between success and failure. A well-run company that adheres to a routine may help staff stay focused and on task.</p>\r\n \r\n<p>Establishing good habits will help you foster an environment where your workforce values one another and strives to deliver their best work every day. As a result, there is a high rate of employee retention, which raises output generally.</p>\r\n </ul>\r\n<p>On the other hand, workplace unrest might result from a firm owner who lacks managerial abilities. You should assess the management abilities of your company\'s executives and managers if you think they are to fault for the output reduction.</p>\r\n \r\n<h5>How much does outsourced product development cost?</h5>\r\n \r\n \r\n<p>Eastern Europe has developed into one of the world\'s main hubs for IT outsourcing, with over a million highly skilled engineers. Ukraine, Poland, Romania, and Belarus are its main outsourcing centers, with typical offshore development charges ranging from $20 to $50.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Eastern Europe has reduced development costs, but the quality is very promising. The presence of technical educational institutions in this area has led to the development of strong and established IT skills. The relatively high level of language competency in Eastern Europe, where the majority of contractors speak English, is another advantage of outsourcing IT services there.</p>\r\n \r\n<p>To make sure that Eastern Europe is the most lucrative choice, let\'s examine the pricing provided by various locations:</p>\r\n\r\n<table class=\"table\">\r\n    <thead>\r\n      <tr>\r\n        <th>Region</th>\r\n        <th>Project Manager</th>\r\n        <th>UI/UX</th>\r\n        <th>QA</th>\r\n        <th>Development</th>\r\n      </tr>\r\n    </thead>\r\n    <tbody>\r\n      <tr>\r\n        <td>Eastern Europe</td>\r\n        <td>$35-60/hr</td>\r\n        <td>$35-60/hr</td>\r\n        <td>$25-50/hr</td>\r\n        <td>$30-80/hr</td>\r\n      </tr>\r\n      <tr>\r\n        <td>Western Europe</td>\r\n        <td>$45-90/hr</td>\r\n        <td>$45-100/hr</td>\r\n        <td>$30-65/hr</td>\r\n        <td>$55-100/hr</td>\r\n      </tr>\r\n      <tr>\r\n        <td>America</td>\r\n        <td><$25-55/hr</td>\r\n        <td><$45/hr</td>\r\n        <td>$20-40/hr</td>\r\n        <td>$25*55/hr</td>\r\n      </tr>\r\n      <tr>\r\n        <td>Asia</td>\r\n        <td><$15-25/hr</td>\r\n        <td><$40/hr</td>\r\n        <td><$30/hr</td>\r\n        <td><$45/hr</td>\r\n      </tr>\r\n    </tbody>\r\n  </table>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>You should keep in mind that regardless of the location where the contractor is from, the price will rise by roughly 15% to 25% as the team\'s expertise level rises.</p>\r\n \r\n<h6>Outsourced Product Development: An Overview and Advice</h6>\r\n \r\n<p>That is one of the reasons smart business owners and product designers are turning more and more to outsourced product development. Developers can produce high-quality goods more rapidly and with less effort thanks to it. To fulfill all of your design and development needs, think of it as a one-stop shop.</p>\r\n<p>If you\'re prepared to advance your product development, start working with the DotOxygen team right away.

(101, 15, 'DotOxygen', '31.07.2022', 'In-house vs Outsourcing Detailed Comparison in 2022', '<p>One of the most contentious issues of the last two decades has been whether to outsource or keep things in-house. Businesses all over the world are utilizing outsourcing business tactics to expand their operations while cutting costs and raising service standards.</p>\r\n \r\n<p>However, although some business owners laud the advantages of outsourcing, others favor in-house teams. Making the best choice is frequently hampered by the confusion caused by such a disparity in entrepreneurs\' experiences.</p>\r\n \r\n<p>We advise contrasting in-house vs. outsourcing approaches to evaluate which is best for your project.</p>\r\n\r\n<h5>What should we talk about?</h5>\r\n \r\n<p>This essay focuses on the in-house vs. outsourced IT debate because it is a hot topic in this industry. You will still experience the same steps regardless of the project type.</p>\r\n \r\n<p>As a result, you will wonder what to do in scenarios and situations comparable to these. We have produced a thorough comparison of outsourcing it vs. in-house to help you decide what is best for your project.</p>\r\n \r\n<p>At various stages of a project\'s development, we shall compare insourced and outsourced software development. You will learn important knowledge that will guide your future decision-making.</p>\r\n\r\n<h6>The expertise of In-House vs. Outsourcing</h6>\r\n \r\n<p>It\'s excellent that the IT sector is flourishing. However, not all designers or developers are fervent about honing their abilities in line with trends. As a result, there is a dearth of talent with a certain set of abilities.</p>\r\n \r\n<p>In turn, outsourcing enables you to employ experts with the knowledge you require in a specific field. You can choose from a bigger selection if you select this model. You will have the option of selecting a team that is ideal for your project and experts that have the required qualifications.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There are areas where outsourcing loses in the expertise ratio, and there are those where it gains. That is typically caused by a person\'s presence or absence. For instance, because local professionals can be underqualified or prohibitively expensive, outsourcing teams\' product development or UI/UX design experience will be more valuable.</p>\r\n \r\n<p>Through outsourcing, you will be able to hire a qualified expert for a fair price and get to work.</p>\r\n \r\n<p>By the end of 2021, Statista estimates that the value of IT services that businesses outsource to outside vendors may exceed $413.72 billion. In terms of expertise, outsourcing triumphs over in-house efforts from 1 to 0.</p>\r\n\r\n<h6>In-House vs. Outsourcing: Management Process</h6>\r\n \r\n<p>When comparing the internal and external models, outsourcing suffers slightly in the management department. Due to constant proximity and seamless communication, managing internal teams is simpler and quicker.</p>\r\n \r\n<p>Since organizations that outsource do not always have access to the team, this model\'s management presents several challenges.</p>\r\n \r\n<p>The world is changing, though. There are many tools available for managing remote teams. The management of the outsourcing team will be successful if you choose the proper one. Let\'s award the internal model one point for now, though. The ratio of outsourcing to internal resources is currently 1:1.</p>\r\n\r\n<h6>Cost</h6>\r\n \r\n<p>Cost is one of the primary factors that business owners consider when deciding whether to insource or outsource software development. A staff unit may initially appear to be significantly less expensive than agency services.</p>\r\n \r\n<p>But upon closer inspection, it appears to be quite the reverse. You earn a respectable sum of money when you add the hired specialist\'s monthly compensation to social benefits, workplace amenities, and advanced training. After that, you hire a contractor and only pay for the work that is completed.</p>\r\n \r\n<p>For the majority of businesses, outsourcing is far more profitable. Due to persistent myths that need to be dispelled, some businesses refuse to cooperate in certain ways. For instance, all outside contractors follow the same template without it.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There may still be such inept firms, but respected organizations do not jeopardize their name and complete their work from start to finish. We have outsourced vs. in-house 2:1 since outsourcing receives one point.</p>\r\n\r\n<h6>Hire Procedure</h6>\r\n \r\n<p>One of the main benefits of outsourcing is the ease with which you can assemble teams of top talent. The time and resources of HR departments are expended on the hiring process. You can build teams far more quickly with the help of a professional recruiter.</p>\r\n \r\n<p>You\'ll have access to a larger pool of engineers and designers with a variety of tech stacks because hiring nearshore costs between 30 and 45 percent less than hiring on-shore.\r\nIt takes time to assemble internal teams. It takes time to find the right engineers or designers and to negotiate with them to join your team. Even then, there is a possibility they won\'t be able to join right away.</p>\r\n \r\n<p>You can find the right individuals quickly if your project is running out of time by hiring an independent contractor or specialized vendor. Outsourcing surpasses in-house in this area, moving ahead it. Outsourcing currently outperforms in-house work 3:1.</p>\r\n\r\n<h6>In-House vs. Outsourced: Models of Collaboration</h6>\r\n \r\n<p>In essence, there are three types of IT outsourcing collaboration models: time & material, set pricing, and dedicated team. You must pay a specified sum of money for a specific scope of work under the fixed-price cooperation model. The amount of money has no bearing on how much effort and time an outsourcing company will put into finishing the task.</p>\r\n \r\n<p>When using the time & material approach, the client doesn\'t pay the agreed-upon sum until features are delivered or milestones are met. In the dedicated team kind of cooperation model, time and resources are devoted to paying the salaries of qualified experts and providing the team with all required equipment.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The model of cooperation in this scenario is hiring an internal team. Every month, you will be required to give the team members the agreed-upon salary. You can see that outsourcing is more profitable when compared to doing things internally. Therefore, outsourcing gains another point, bringing our total to 4:1.</p>\r\n \r\n<h6>Risks of both in-house and outsourcing</h6>\r\n<p>Taking on less risk is another fantastic benefit of outsourcing. You can lessen the chance of such threats by deciding on this model:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>time hazards </li>\r\n<li>financial hazards</li>\r\n<li>operational dangers</li>\r\n<li>technological dangers</li>\r\n<li>external dangers</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>Outsourcing is always governed by a formal contract. It also includes certain other crucial elements like the payment clause, deadline, performance clause, confidentiality clause, withdrawal clause, and others in addition to the scope of work and NDA (non-disclosure agreement).</p>\r\n<p>Furthermore, outsourcing involves more than merely handing off your duties to a different business. It\'s more like collaboration and teamwork. As a result, both businesses automatically share the advantages and dangers of this procedure.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Low retention rates are the major danger you have when working with internal staff. Developers and designers are changing employment more frequently as a result of the increased demand and alluring packages being provided by rival businesses. Consequently, there is always a chance that your main developer or designer will switch roles at a crucial project phase. Once more, outsourcing is effective, and as a result, the ratio of outsourcing to in-house work is 5 to 1.</p>\r\n\r\n<h6>Quality Assurance</h6>\r\n \r\n<p>When comparing control between in-house and outsourcing, outsourcing comes out on the losing end. Perhaps the most frequent issue with outsourcing is a lack of involvement and control over the project.</p>\r\n<p>However, this issue may be prevented by outlining all of your requirements, setting up project charters, and generating milestones. You can manage your job in this way.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>You will have more control over all work processes if you hire an in-house staff because they will frequently work together in a single workplace and be always accessible to you. It would be reasonable to award the victory to internal teams in this situation. The ratio of outsourcing to in-house work is 5:2.</p>\r\n \r\n<h6>The Right Fit</h6>\r\n \r\n<p>Working with individuals who share the same culture and ideals is a benefit of hiring an internal staff. This facilitates employees\' successful integration into the business and enables them to offer value to their work.</p>\r\n \r\n<p>Cultural misalignment may be a problem when selecting an outsourcing team for your project. Therefore, it is advised to hunt for a team in Eastern Europe to prevent this issue.</p>\r\n<p>We will award internal teams a point in this situation as well. However, outsourcing triumphs by a margin of two points, with the final score being 5:3 for outsourcing over in-house.</p>\r\n\r\n<h6>Practice with Outsourcing and In-House Teams at Different Project Stages</h6>\r\n \r\n<p>The primary distinctions between internal and external outsourcing have already been discussed. Let\'s now examine the specificity of these two models at various project development stages.</p>\r\n \r\n<h6>Outsourcing vs. Internal: Discovery stage</h6>\r\n<p>Product discovery teams that outsource do so more affordably, but that does not necessarily mean they are better and produce higher-quality results than an in-house team. See why this is the case. If your organization employs a business analyst, he is always by your side.</p>\r\n \r\n<p>He is fully committed to your project, recognizes the issue, can attend all meetings and workshops, and does a swift and thorough analysis of everything. An individual like that might cost more, but they\'ll be more beneficial and do the job well.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Teams will be considerably less expensive to outsource. But you must keep in mind that proper management is necessary for a successful outcome. We advise hiring an internal, highly specialized employee or exceptional, not cheap, outsourcing professionals if you have a big, complicated job.</p>\r\n \r\n \r\n<p>For small and medium-sized projects, we advise selecting an outsourcing team. However, don\'t overlook effective supervision and control of such a team.</p>\r\n \r\n<h6>Stage of UX/UI Design</h6>\r\n<p>Teams that outsource UI/UX design comes out on top in every way. First, the cost has decreased. Second, the level of quality is comparable to that of internal teams.</p>\r\n<p>However, it is important to keep in mind the outsourcing country when making this decision. Eastern Europe provides affordable, high-quality services.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The drawback of UI/UX outsourcing is that it can be more difficult for outsourced teams than in-house teams to undertake research, testing, etc. Again, effective management makes up for it.</p>\r\n \r\n<p>When working with an outsourced team, you must establish frequent communication, clearly express your ideas and needs, properly develop technical specifications, etc. to achieve good results. You will get the most out of the outsourced team and accomplish your goals once you have created these processes.</p>\r\n\r\n<h6>Comparing internal and external software development</h6>\r\n \r\n<p>You will undoubtedly save money by choosing to outsource developers during the software development stage because a top-notch onshore developer is highly expensive.</p>\r\n \r\n<p>The benefit of outsourcing is that you can select a specialist who is appropriate for your product and has a specific set of abilities and knowledge from a wide talent pool.</p>\r\n \r\n<p>The drawback of outsourcing is that you might not be able to quickly address any issues and monitor the developer\'s progress. However, the management problem remains the same. Create an effective control and management process, and you\'ll receive a top-notch product on schedule.</p>\r\n\r\n<h6>QA Phase</h6>\r\n<p>The software development project is still ongoing beyond the development phase. It must pass several product testing procedures before it can be released. Outsourcing QA services is significantly preferable to building your QA team from scratch if you don\'t already have an experienced in-house software testing team or if your current staff is small.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The benefits of outsourcing software testing and quality assurance services, as well as how to make use of them, are as follows:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>You can choose the best employees from software testing outsourcing companies that focus on your areas of concern when you outsource product testing.</li>\r\n<li>The task of software quality assurance may be challenging for your staff. Therefore, by outsourcing software testing, your company may focus on product development and other crucial business operations.</li>\r\n<li>No matter how great a writer\'s work is, it must be reviewed by an editor. Software engineers can also be compared to engineers. Outsourcing software testing companies can identify any weaknesses that your staff may have.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h6>Project Support: In-House vs. Outsourcing</h6>\r\n \r\n<p>To respond rapidly to issues with the product that may develop during project support, it is preferable to have an inside team.</p>\r\n \r\n<p>Because they are right there with you and your project, your in-house team will be able to respond swiftly. After talking through everything, you may make a decision right away because the team is well familiar with your project.<p>\r\n \r\n<p>You won\'t experience any issues with project support, though, if communication with the outsourcing staff is optimized. However, there is always a chance.</p>\r\n\r\n<h6>IT Consultation</h6>\r\n \r\n \r\n<p>If your business needs IT assistance, we advise choosing to outsource. First off, there are a lot of skilled and experienced consultants working abroad.</p>\r\n \r\n<p>Second, hiring consultants through outsourcing will be less expensive for you than hiring an internal employee.</p>\r\n \r\n<p>Third, you probably won\'t always require a consultant. You employ consultants when you require assistance with a certain project or stage of this project.</p>\r\n \r\n<h6>Project Scaling: In-House vs. Outsourcing</h6>\r\n \r\n<p>The majority of businesses want to expand and advance. Scaling presents difficulties, risks, and pressure at every stage. Outsourcing steps to the rescue at this moment are prepared to quickly integrate into corporate operations and boost efficiency or broaden the company\'s capabilities.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The degree to which each specialist is prepared and able to collaborate on particular projects, as well as their level, matter in a team. It is not sufficient to merely hire tenacious professionals. You must confirm that they can and want to complete the task following the standards of excellence set by your business. A specialist needs to be replaced if he fails.</p>\r\n \r\n<p>Additionally, since there are more people, they change more frequently, which calls for ongoing work with the staff. Additionally, the growth of the population brings with it communication issues. All processes will start to sag if you don\'t give them enough thought.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>You purchase a turnkey team when you join an outsourcing provider. This means that the customer simply needs to provide the layouts and technical specifications to receive the finished product rather than creating the development process and following it.</p>\r\n \r\n<h6>Summary of \"In-House vs. Outsourcing\"</h6>\r\n \r\n<p>More and more business owners are outsourcing due to the advantages of doing business with an overseas crew. Working with offshore developers or designers will help you uncover dependable team members that are committed to the success of your company.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>At first, look, hiring an in-house developer could seem like a fantastic idea, but there are some significant drawbacks. It takes a lot of time and effort to identify and hire the best candidates, communicate your goals, and get the most out of the developer or designer. That may cause you to become confused and lose focus on important business operations.</p>\r\n \r\n<p>Only by evaluating the issue for oneself is it possible to choose the optimal viewpoint. You can focus your efforts on the things that demand your attention by outsourcing the majority of the planning and execution of some of your burdens. </p>\r\n', '743539-In_house_vs_outsourcing_detailed_comparison_in_2022.jpg', 'Branding, Website Design, Website Development, User Interface, User Experience', '2031-07-20 21:00:00.00000', '31.07.2022'),

After all, they\'ll feel like they had a say in the choice you make.</p>\r\n \r\n<h6>Value to the group</h6>\r\n \r\n<p>Enables the team to become familiar with the company, ask and receive answers to questions, discover crucial information about the project, users, and business, as well as organize meetings and other organizational issues that have an impact on the product\'s successful launch.</p>\r\n \r\n<h6>Business value</h6>\r\n<p>Aids in understanding the potential value the product can have for a company.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Preparation time: 2 to 4 hours for stakeholder interviews and up to 4 hours for a kick-off meeting.</p>\r\n<p>The primary activity will last a kick-off meeting for 1 to 3 hours and stakeholder interviews for 1 to 2 hours.</p>\r\n\r\n<h5>The steps are taken to be ready for the kick-off meeting:</h5>\r\n<p>To ensure that everyone is included in the process, a meeting with all the stakeholders and interested parties must be organized.</p>\r\n \r\n<p>You don\'t have to go into specifics about the project. The essential duty is to comprehend the high-level needs and choose the objectives the team will pursue to succeed. Since this is likely the only opportunity you will have to speak with the company and present yourself as a highly skilled professional, it is advisable to prepare thoroughly for the meeting.</p>\r\n\r\n<h6>Step 1: Information gathering</h6>\r\n<p>This crucial phase directly affects the effectiveness and result of the meeting. You can use the \"Desk research\" strategy I discussed in the previous article to get ready for this phase. You should also try to talk about the development process and find out if there are any constraints in this area (frameworks: Scrum, Waterfall or Kanban, etc.).</p>\r\n \r\n<h6>Step 2: Construct and distribute a meeting agenda to all attendees.</h6>\r\n<p>Everyone needs to know what will happen, in what order, and what needs to be prepared for it, as well as the questions you plan to ask and the results you hope to obtain.</p>\r\n\r\n<h6>Step 3: Introductions during the meeting.</h6>\r\n<p>It is important to introduce yourself as a specialist as fast as possible. Include information about who you are, your experience, the job you have, what you will do for this project, your responsibilities, and how to contact you.</p>\r\n \r\n<p><b>Review of business.</b></p>\r\n<p>Request information from the stakeholders regarding the company and its strategy. Understanding how firms aim to make money, the intricacies of their industry, the constraints and dangers that could cause them to fail, etc., is crucial for you.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><b>Project evaluation</b></p>\r\n<p>You must first comprehend the issues that the team will attempt to resolve, the goal of your product or service, and the benefits that users will derive from the project. Ask the stakeholders how they decided that these issues are real and that this upcoming product can address them. Additionally, it would be excellent of us if we determined the project success measures. The team will thus be aware of the project\'s success or failure, the extent to which user issues have been resolved, and the level of business satisfaction. Additionally, find out if the stakeholders have any UX research they can share with you.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><b>Describe the intended audience (based on a subjective vision from the business side).</b></p>\r\n<p>It is important to understand the users\' objectives, their wants and problems, and how the solution will address them. Users may currently be utilizing well-known products. If an interactive wireframe is created, find out if there will be a chance to explore it and speak with users. If so, undertake usability testing.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Competitive research What are the product\'s primary and secondary competitors? is a crucial question to ask. The strategies of rivals or other insiders may be known to the stakeholders.<p>\r\n\r\n<p><b>Team terminology.</b></p>\r\n<p>It is important to decide who will be in charge of what tasks and what part they will play in the project. Additionally, you need to determine who will contribute to the project, who you may contact with inquiries about the company, etc. The RACI matrix can be used for such activities (responsible, accountable, consulted, and informed).</p>\r\n \r\n<p><b>Deadline.</b></p>\r\n<p>Learn about the project submission deadlines and the interim dates for the project status presentation.</p>\r\n<p><b>Discuss the procedure for approving designs.</b></p>\r\n<p>The procedure for a design approval must be discussed, and it is ideal if just one person makes the final call. The same holds for the project\'s updates. Additionally, it is essential to talk about the procedure for altering the specifications (for example, the team has done some work, it was approved, but the client wants to change something).</p>\r\n\r\n<h6>Step 4: Meeting minutes and follow-up (MFU)</h6>\r\n<p>All of the meeting notes that were discussed are included in this document. Writing a letter to the stakeholders in the last stage. The accountable party will outline everything that occurred at this gathering (what was discussed, what was decided, what was pledged, what the stakeholders should give, etc.), as well as the date of the subsequent meeting.</p>\r\n \r\n<h6>Interviewing stakeholders</h6>\r\n \r\n<p>You must go back to the artifact from the earlier stage of Desk research after you have completed a Kick-off meeting and booked the following sessions for interviews with stakeholders. The questions, conclusions, and hypotheses you need to raise during meetings to receive insightful responses should all be included in this paper.</p>\r\n\r\n', '747401-kick_off_meeting_and_stakeholder_interviews.jpg', 'Branding, Website Design, Website Development, User Interface, User Experience', '2005-07-20 21:00:00.00000', '05.07.2022');

(103, 17, 'DotOxygen', '08.06.2022', 'Mobile App Design Cost Calculate Your Design Cost In 10 Min', '<p>Application development costs include a distinct line item for mobile app design. When your app is installed on a user\'s device, the design is the first thing they see. The look and feel of your mobile app give users the first impression of your program when they learn how practical and simple to use it is. As a result, a design has a big impact on whether or not a user will stick with it.</p>\r\n \r\n<p>Design consequently becomes crucial. But how much does designing an app cost? What variables affect the price? How can I avoid overpaying for app design? In this post, you\'ll find the answers to these and many other questions.</p>\r\n\r\n<h5>What is included in the price of a mobile app?</h5>\r\n<p>Mobile application design is a difficult process that includes numerous processes, much like the process of designing products. As a result, mobile app design pricing is likewise quite complicated.</p>\r\n \r\n<p>Yes, creating a mobile app takes time and knowledge. The complexity of your project and the seniority of the designers are the two key variables that impact the ultimate cost. Let\'s go over the main stages of developing a mobile application, such as product research, UI/UX design, and testing, to find out how the pricing is established at each one.</p>\r\n\r\n<h6>Cost of Mobile App Development: Product Research</h6>\r\n<p>The research and exploration phases are where it all begins; this is what the product discovery phase is about. During that time, your designers will become familiar with the app, its intended user base, your idea of the finished product, and the goals of your project.</p>\r\n \r\n<p>Since effective planning is the foundation of product discovery, numerous interviews are necessary, including ones with users, stakeholders, and you, the consumer. Additionally, it is crucial to conduct a SWOT analysis and a detailed investigation of your competition.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>At the product discovery stage, DotOxygen also considers the business strategy, develops personas, and user stories, and prepares customer journey maps.</p>\r\n \r\n<p>It is time to move on to the following step, which is UX design, once designers have a solid understanding of the concept and the demands and desires of the product.</p>\r\n \r\n<h6>Cost of UX Design for Mobile Apps</h6>\r\n<p>Two essential tools that help you understand how your end users interact with screens and information flow are mind maps and site maps. Wireframing indeed allows you to see your application in operation. It is a quick and economical technique to visualize the idea and make modifications with the fewest resources needed. Depending on the intricacy of the project, wireframing and the fundamental design of the app can take anywhere from 14 to 140 hours.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Wireframing is typically part of the UX design stage, which can take anywhere between 100 and 200 hours, depending on how sophisticated your project is.</p>\r\n \r\n<p>The app\'s appearance and usability are both the responsibility of UX and UI, which we will discuss later. UX is concerned with how the user feels when utilizing your software, including whether it is practical, logical, and easy to use. There is no set formula for producing the ideal user experience.</p>\r\n \r\n<p>But DotOxygen has developed best practices that enable us to guide our clients over the difficult road of the mobile app design process.</p>\r\n \r\n\r\n<h6>Cost of UI Design for Mobile Apps</h6>\r\n<p>The application\'s visual communication, or UI design, is the stage after that, and it determines whether or not the UX designers\' overarching concept is maintained. Delivering pages and screens, branding, internal layers, color schemes, and the overall aesthetic are all the responsibilities of UI designers. A simple software may require 80 hours of UI design work, whereas a more complex app may require 200 hours.</p>\r\n \r\n<p>Professionals from DotOxygen also produced the UI design for StockApp. Based on user feedback, we enhanced the UI design elements during the prototyping and deployment stages.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This customer contacted us because they wanted to improve the design\'s usability and engagement. The extensive research and analytics performed by DotOxygen professionals enabled them to reconstruct the client journey and smoothen it out. Additionally, we have made the navigation simpler, enhanced it, added a useful feed, and more.</p>\r\n \r\n<h6>Cost of Creating a Mobile App: Testing</h6>\r\n<p>In-depth focus group interviews, assessment study preparation, and the creation of usability reports are frequently necessary throughout the testing phase.</p>\r\n\r\nDotOxygen established a UX lab to make this procedure as effective as feasible for our clients. <p>The DotOxygen lab user receives a product prototype. We discover how the user behaves when interacting with the product interface with the aid of specialized eye-tracking hardware. Following that, it is then feasible to examine actual user behavior and alter the product.\r\nWe at DotOxygen have excellent experience with every phase of developing mobile applications.\r\nAt every level of the app development process, we design, create and maintain B2B/B2C businesses. We have assisted clients from 45+ different countries and contributed to over 140 projects, and we have no plans to stop.</p>\r\n\r\n<h5>How much does designing a mobile app cost?</h5>\r\n \r\n<p>We already know what work will be covered in the final pricing because we have already covered important stages of mobile app design. But how much does creating a mobile app cost?</p>\r\n \r\n<p>As per usual, it depends: on the project\'s size and complexity, the amount of time needed, the seniority of the specialists participating, and the nation in which your team is based.</p>\r\n<p>Additionally, when it comes to the experts working on your project, many organizations decide to use freelancers or design firms. Such a strategy has the advantage of cost-optimization because, normally, you only require a mobile app designer for a short time each year, so it makes sense to hire them.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Let\'s examine the pros and cons of working with design firms against independent contractors because you should be aware of both to make an informed choice.</p>\r\n \r\n<p>Individual freelancers typically charge less than those working for design firms. Consider hiring freelancers if you have a tight budget, only need to make minor design changes, or have a small project.</p>\r\n \r\n<p>Although it\'s important to remember that since freelancers generally have multiple projects going at once, they might not give your application their full attention. If you choose to work with a group of freelancers, there is a chance that there will be misunderstandings, gaps in knowledge, missed deadlines, etc. (especially if they are from various places).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Working with a design agency is a better option if you need to assemble a competent team and your design is sophisticated.</p>\r\n \r\n<p>We\'ll now look at the typical prices for designers in various cities and at various levels of seniority.</p>\r\n\r\n<h6>Prices for designing mobile apps by nation</h6>\r\n<p>Various sources claim that outsourcing mobile application design services might help you save anywhere between 30 and 60 percent of your money. To reduce costs, many firms prefer to outsource the creation of mobile apps.</p>\r\n \r\n<p>The three most common locations for outsourcing are Eastern Europe, Asia, and Latin America. Each of these places is unique, and the costs vary accordingly. Let\'s look at the price of creating an app for these locations.</p>\r\n\r\n<h6>Eastern Europe: App design cost</h6>\r\n \r\n<p>The price of developing a mobile app in Eastern Europe varies by nation. Yes, Ukrainian creators of mobile apps charge less than their counterparts in Poland or Romania. In general, rates are lower in countries where the cost of living is lower. Therefore, we advise adding the Numbeo cost of living index to the calculation.</p>\r\n \r\n<h6>In Eastern Europe, prices for mobile app creation are determined by seniority level.</h6>\r\n \r\n<p>A junior mobile app designer will cost you about $25 per hour, while a senior would run you about $50 per hour, according to the seniority of the local pros.</p>\r\n \r\n<p>The primary services involved in the mobile application design are priced in the following range:</p>\r\n<table class=\"table\">\r\n    <thead>\r\n      <tr>\r\n        <th>Product discovery</th>\r\n        <th>Project Management</th>\r\n        <th>UX design</th>\r\n        <th>UI design</th>\r\n        <th>Usability testing</th>\r\n      </tr>\r\n    </thead>\r\n      <tr>\r\n        <td>Price per hour</td>\r\n        <td>$25-55/hr</td>\r\n        <td><$45/hr</td>\r\n        <td><$40/hr</td>\r\n        <td><$30/hr</td>\r\n      </tr>\r\n</table>\r\n\r\n<h6>App design costs: Asia</h6>\r\n \r\n<p>The going rate for a junior mobile app designer in Asia is $10–$15, and the going rate for a senior mobile app designer is $20–$30.</p>\r\n \r\n<p>Despite having the lowest unemployment rates in the world, Asia lags behind other regions in terms of digital adoption and Internet quality. Remember that these characteristics could make it difficult for you to work with designers who are headquartered in Asia.</p>\r\n \r\n<p>The pricing table for product research, UX/UI design, and usability testing in Asia can be seen below.</p>\r\n<table class=\"table\">\r\n    <thead>\r\n      <tr>\r\n        <th>Product discovery</th>\r\n        <th>Project Management</th>\r\n        <th>UX design</th>\r\n        <th>UI design</th>\r\n        <th>Usability testing</th>\r\n      </tr>\r\n    </thead>\r\n      <tr>\r\n        <td>Price per hour</td>\r\n        <td>$15-25/hr</td>\r\n        <td>$15-30/hr</td>\r\n        <td>$10-25/hr</td>\r\n        <td><$20/hr</td>\r\n      </tr>\r\n</table>\r\n<h6>App design costs: Latin America</h6>\r\n \r\n<p>Geographic closeness and a short time difference are two important considerations that influence enterprises (mostly US-based ones) to outsource mobile app design to Latin America.</p>\r\n \r\n<p>If you decide to work with a junior mobile app designer in Mexico, Argentina, or another Latin American nation, be prepared to pay between $30 and $50 per hour for these individuals.</p>\r\n<table class=\"table\">\r\n    <thead>\r\n      <tr>\r\n        <th>Product discovery</th>\r\n        <th>Project Management</th>\r\n        <th>UX design</th>\r\n        <th>UI design</th>\r\n        <th>Usability testing</th>\r\n      </tr>\r\n    </thead>\r\n      <tr>\r\n        <td>Price per hour</td>\r\n        <td>$25-55/hr</td>\r\n        <td>$45/hr</td>\r\n        <td>$40/hr</td>\r\n        <td>$30/hr</td>\r\n      </tr>\r\n</table>\r\n\r\n<h6>Mobile app design costs broken down on project size</h6>\r\n<p>Typically, we categorize projects into a startup, medium, and enterprise levels based on their complexity.</p>\r\n \r\n<p>The scale of your project will also affect how much it costs to build an app. Small or startup initiatives are less expensive since they take less time to design and have fewer people engaged. Startup-level initiatives typically require 150 hours of design time. When will other project kinds be completed? Let\'s together research this.</p>\r\n\r\n<h6>Timeline and the final cost of mobile app design</h6>\r\n \r\n<p>The size of your business, the complexity of your app, the experience level of your staff, and other factors can affect timing just like they can affect cost. Even the simplest jobs, meanwhile, take time to complete. To make this procedure as quick as possible, it is to your best advantage to cooperate with competent professionals.</p>\r\n \r\n<p>Knowing the timeline can help you estimate your project\'s cost since the cost of mobile app design is mostly dependent on the amount of time spent on the actual design.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The design process consists of the four stages of product discovery, user experience design, user interface design, and usability testing, as we said previously. Here at DotOxygen, we have developed best practices that allow us to complete each phase as quickly as possible without sacrificing quality. Now let\'s look at how long it takes us to construct mobile apps for businesses of various sizes.</p>\r\n<h5>How much does creating an app for a startup cost?</h5>\r\n<p>Startups often spend the shortest amount of time designing mobile applications. The approximate timing of each stage of the development of a mobile app is shown in the table below. However, take in mind that the calculation is not universal and that the amount of time needed for your project may vary.</p>\r\n<table class=\"table\">\r\n    <thead>\r\n      <tr>\r\n        <th>Product discovery</th>\r\n        <th>Project Management</th>\r\n        <th>UX design</th>\r\n        <th>UI design</th>\r\n        <th>Usability testing</th>\r\n      </tr>\r\n    </thead>\r\n      <tr>\r\n        <td>Time required</td>\r\n        <td>30-60 hours</td>\r\n        <td>60-120 hours</td>\r\n        <td>50-100 hours</td>\r\n        <td>40 hours</td>\r\n      </tr>\r\n</table>\r\n\r\n<h5>How much do create an app for a middle-sized company cost?</h5>\r\n<p>Middle-sized businesses often have a clear vision of what they want and a set of specifications in place.</p>\r\n<p>For instance, we\'ve received wireframes and general ideas from our client StockApp. This method enables time savings for user and company research. According to DotOxygen\'s experience, middle-sized firms typically need the following amount of time to design mobile apps:</p>\r\n<table class=\"table\">\r\n    <thead>\r\n      <tr>\r\n        <th>Product discovery</th>\r\n        <th>Project Management</th>\r\n        <th>UX design</th>\r\n        <th>UI design</th>\r\n        <th>Usability testing</th>\r\n      </tr>\r\n    </thead>\r\n      <tr>\r\n        <td>Time required</td>\r\n        <td>60-120 hours</td>\r\n        <td>120-200 hours</td>\r\n        <td>110-220 hours</td>\r\n        <td>40-80 hours</td>\r\n      </tr>\r\n</table>\r\n<h5>How much does it cost to create an app for a business?</h5>\r\n<p>Enterprise-level clients typically create complicated products with several design specifications. They want to invest in designs that would make their goods recognizable and draw in lots of customers.</p>\r\n \r\n<p>As a result, performing extensive business research, market analysis, wireframing, usability testing, etc. takes a lot of time.</p>\r\n \r\n<p>The time needed to create an enterprise app is displayed in the table below:</p>\r\n<table class=\"table\">\r\n    <thead>\r\n      <tr>\r\n        <th>Product discovery</th>\r\n        <th>Project Management</th>\r\n        <th>UX design</th>\r\n        <th>UI design</th>\r\n        <th>Usability testing</th>\r\n      </tr>\r\n    </thead>\r\n      <tr>\r\n        <td>Time required</td>\r\n        <td>120-240 hours</td>\r\n        <td>200-500 hours</td>\r\n        <td>400-600 hours</td>\r\n        <td>80 hours</td>\r\n      </tr>\r\n</table>\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Use basic math by multiplying the cost by the amount of time to determine how much it will cost to design your app. For starters, here are the approximate expenses for start-ups, mid-sized organizations, and enterprise companies if you decide to hire mobile app designers in Eastern Europe:</p>\r\n<table class=\"table\">\r\n    <thead>\r\n      <tr>\r\n        <th>Startups</th>\r\n        <th>Middle-size</th>\r\n        <th>Enterprise size</th>\r\n      </tr>\r\n    </thead>\r\n      <tr>\r\n        <td>$15,000-50,000</td>\r\n        <td>$35,000-70,000</td>\r\n        <td>$70,000-150,000</td>\r\n      </tr>\r\n</table>\r\n\r\n<h6>Cost of Mobile App Design: Estimate Your Design</h6>\r\n \r\n \r\n<p>You can use this list of necessary procedures to estimate your app design costs:</p>\r\n <ul>\r\n<li>how complex your project is?</li>\r\n<li>How many pages are there in your app? </li>\r\n<li>Do they create design or redesign? </li>\r\n<li>Do you have a distinct concept for how your app will look? </li>\r\n<li>Do you require custom design work, or can your designers use pre-made templates?</li>\r\n </ul>\r\n<h6>Choose experts and their location</h6>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Which expert do you require? </li>\r\n<li>Are business analysts necessary? </li>\r\n<li>How many professionals are needed to complete the project?</li>\r\n<li>Calculate the project\'s expected completion date?</li>\r\n<li>How long will it take to complete your project?</li>\r\n </ul>\r\n\r\n<h6>Summary</h6>\r\n<p>What is the price of designing an app?

No one will be surprised by the existence of a website or an application today. The moment has come to move on. One of the secrets to success becomes constant communication with the user.</p>\r\n \r\n<p>Progressive web applications are designed to minimize any obstacles to businesses maintaining constant contact with their clients and to make this engagement as easy as possible. Let\'s examine the fundamentals of this technology and the price of a progressive web app./p>\r\n\r\n<h6>What is the progressive web app development process?</h6>\r\n \r\n<p>PWA development: What is it? A PWA combines the features of a mobile app and a website. As a result, the product will engage with users the way the application does. Regardless matter whether they have an internet connection, anyone can use PWA. Direct download and installation of an application with a one-click installation from the browser are possible and simple.</p>\r\n \r\n<p>In other words, it is a novel form of interaction with the target market that is easily carried out through web technologies. According to Quartz, more than 80% of smartphone users don\'t download any apps for a full month.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>PWA users can immediately install apps. Updates automatically are supported. It is even more convenient if the site has a functional offline version that allows you to access it without using push notifications.</p>\r\n \r\n<h6>What distinguishes a progressive web app from a native app?</h6>\r\n<p>An online program that aims to provide a seamless, native-like user experience is known as a progressive web app. PWAs operate in the browser, but native mobile applications must be downloaded from an app store. The main difference between these two types of software is that one emphasizes utility while the other emphasizes style.</p>\r\n<p>Users\' data is cached while utilizing progressive web apps. If we give users the option to stay updated constantly, regardless of the speed of their Internet connection.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The fact that PWAs are independent of app stores is a benefit. About 25% of smartphone users, according to The Manifest, remove apps because their devices\' storage is full. Progressive web apps offer a lot of independence as a result.</p>\r\n \r\n<p>The functionality of Progressive Web Applications is that they contain URLs, which causes Google to index them. Customers can quickly find them using a search engine. Even when a user is not online, PWAs can be used.</p>\r\n \r\n<p>Another benefit is that developing progressive web apps is less expensive than creating native apps. Additionally, the process of creating progressive web apps is quicker and simpler. Native application development involves a variety of unique and specialized technology.</p>\r\n\r\n<h6>What distinguishes a responsive application from a progressive web application?</h6>\r\n<p>One of the biggest distinctions between a progressive web app (PWA) and a responsive app is how quickly PWAs load across all device kinds. Progressive web apps keep a lot of data offline, however, users of responsive web apps won\'t be able to operate offline.</p>\r\n \r\n<p>When it comes to offering a top-notch user experience that enables websites to be more visually appealing, PWAs are at the top of the list. PWAs can run on various platforms, in contrast to responsive applications.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>However, responsive web apps are less expensive to design than progressive web apps. Only when contrasted to the responsive web app, this is likely the only response to the question of why PWA is awful. That is most likely the sole explanation for why PWA is subpar when compared to responsive web apps. Let\'s first identify the main advantages of utilizing PWAs before we begin to assess the cost of progressive web apps.</p>\r\n \r\n<h6>Cost Of A Progressive Web App: Important Information</h6>\r\n \r\n<p>What is the price of creating a website? Of course, this should be our primary focus in this post. Costs for developing progressive web applications and mobile applications vary widely. Let\'s examine each of them more closely.</p>\r\n\r\n<h6>Project\'s size</h6>\r\n<p>The scale of your project will have the biggest impact on the price of developing an application. A smaller project takes less time to develop. As a result, these initiatives are less expensive. You\'ll probably need more team members, more time, and more resources for bigger projects.</p>\r\n \r\n<p>Small projects also make it simpler to find issues and fix them. With large ones, it might be confusing and takes more time and effort to rethink certain portions of the application or address issues.</p>\r\n<h6>The project\'s complexity</h6>\r\n \r\n<p>The price of developing a progressive web application also relies on how complicated your project is. It costs more the more complicated it is. Designers and developers with experience and skills are typically needed for complex projects. Not all businesses can offer such teams.</p>\r\n\r\n<h6>Technical aspects</h6>\r\n<p>Naturally, the price of developing an application relies on how many various features you intend to include. You will be required to pay more for the more features and intricate features you wish to add.</p>\r\n \r\n<p>This element and the project\'s complexity are strongly related. A group of experts with a tonne of experience creating different web applications, including PWA, is what you\'ll need.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Typically, businesses that wish to provide their users with advanced options must pay extra. To increase brand identity, client loyalty, etc., more features are required. The cost of a web application will be modest, nevertheless, if you only need a typical application with a minimal set of functionality. The price of a progressive web app is also influenced by the features that you require for your product.</p>\r\n \r\n<h6>Performance</h6>\r\n<p>Every activity your platform is capable of performing is functional. The product\'s functionality is what gives it most of its worth. You will need an experienced team with knowledge of designing application architecture, logic, and navigation if you want your future progressive web application to function efficiently and smoothly.</p>\r\n\r\n<h6>Nation of the contractor</h6>\r\n<p>The country of the contractor has an impact on the price of the progressive web app. One of the most significant and intriguing aspects determining the price of developing an application is likely the nation of the contractor.</p>\r\n \r\n<p>Depending on where your contractor is located, you could pay anything from $200,000 to $50,000 for the identical solution. The final cost of the PWA will always depend on the company\'s local market. Because of this, if you ask Swiss or American developers what the typical pricing is to construct a website, they will give you the most expensive quote.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>High progressive web app cost does not always equate to outstanding quality when it comes to developing progressive web applications. This becomes clear when you examine the prices of employing teams from around the world.</p>\r\n \r\n<h6>Here are some typical costs for creating PWAs per developer\'s hour of work:</h6>\r\n \r\n \r\n<p>The average cost of creating an application in the US and Australia is $50 per hour of labor. The application starts at $15,000 and gets more expensive from there.</p>\r\n \r\n<p>A developer from the UK will typically charge $70 per hour. The price of an application might be as little as $21,000.</p>\r\n \r\n<p>The typical price per hour of development for a mobile app in Italy is $80. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>Developers from Ukraine make an average of $30 per hour. The price of an application might be as low as $9000.</p>\r\n \r\n<p>When asked how much their work typically costs, Indian coders will reply that it is $20. The price of an application might be as little as $6000.</p>\r\n\r\n<h6>Contractor\'s background</h6>\r\n<p>The cost to construct a web application will, of course, depend on the contractor\'s skills as well as the nation in which they are based. Nothing about this is complicated. The cost of the job will increase with the level of experience of your contractor.</p>\r\n \r\n<p>When assessing experience, it\'s critical to take into account factors like the number of years spent working in the field, instances of previously built apps, client testimonials, etc.</p>\r\n \r\n<p>However, don\'t assume that profitable businesses would overcharge you. For instance, several excellent web design and development companies in Eastern Europe provide their services at fair pricing while producing excellent and high-quality work.</p>\r\n\r\n<h6>Exemplified by cooperation</h6>\r\n<p>The cooperation model is the final element that affects the price of progressive web apps. Fixed pricing and time and material (T&M) models are two different sorts of models. Let\'s analyze them swiftly.</p>\r\n \r\n<p>In a fixed-price approach, the customer pays the contractor for the finished product at an agreed-upon price and terms of work. The task scope and deadlines are accurately estimated, and meeting the deadlines and the budget allotted takes precedence. In this strategy, achieving deadlines and budgets at the expense of results and quality is possible.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This model\'s key benefit is that the cost is predictable and fixed. However, during the development phase, you won\'t be allowed to add any components, make any important modifications, or change the application\'s concept at all. Additionally, the specialist rate in this approach costs roughly 15-20% more than Time & Material.</p>\r\n \r\n<p>The customer pays for the process, i.e., following the real-time spent working by the specialists, under the time and material model. The major concern is the outcome and quality; an approximation of the work\'s scope and implementation time is made.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This model\'s key benefit is that the cost is predictable and fixed.

The major concern is the outcome and quality; an approximation of the work\'s scope and implementation time is made.</p>\r\n\r\n<h6>BA & Product Research</h6>\r\n<p>The business analysis and product discovery stages are strongly related to the size of your company. More time will be spent on this step the larger your firm is. Additionally, the price to create a website and app will increase the longer it takes.</p>\r\n \r\n<p>It is also essential to take into account your company\'s particulars, like its wants and requirements. All of this will have an impact on how long it takes to complete this phase of developing a progressive web app.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For your convenience, we calculated how long this stage will take for different sizes of businesses:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Enterprises: 60-120 hours.</li>\r\n<li>Middle-size project: 30-60 hours.</li>\r\n<li>Small projects: 15-30 hours.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h6>Designing UX/UI</h6>\r\n<p>One of the significant phases of developing a progressive web app is UX/UI design. This stage needs ongoing client confirmation, element corrections, upgrades, etc.</p>\r\n \r\n<p>Checking each application page individually when they become available will help you save a little time at this point. By doing this, the designer will be able to repair or enhance what you want right away and won\'t have to waste time working on it later.</p>\r\n \r\n<p>Of course, how long UX/UI design takes depends on how complex it is and how well the design specifications are written.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We have prepared information about how long UX/UI design will take for different sizes of companies:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Enterprises: 100-250 hours (UX), 200-300 hours (UI).</li>\r\n<li>Middle-size project: 60-100 hours (UX), 55-110 hours (UI).</li>\r\n<li>Small projects: 30-45 hours (UX), 25-50 (UI).</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Let us analyze how much time you need for this stage:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Enterprises: 20-50 hours (technical documentation), 250-500 hours (frontend), 300-600 hours (backend). </li>\r\n<li>Middle-size projects: 12-25 hours (technical documentation), 120-200 hours (frontend), 130-210 hours (backend).</li>\r\n<li>Small projects: 8-10 hours (technical documentation), 70-90 hours (frontend), 80-100 hours (backend).</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>Since developers work on the frontend and backend in parallel, the time error can be 15-20%.</p>\r\n\r\n<h6>Internet Development</h6>\r\n<p>The largest and most time-consuming stage in web development. The intricacy of your future progressive web application\'s functionality, the number of extra features, the difficulty of the logic and navigation, and other factors will all affect how long the process takes.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>We have prepared information about how long UX/UI design will take for different sizes of companies:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Enterprises: 100-250 hours (UX), 200-300 hours (UI).</li>\r\n<li>Middle-size project: 60-100 hours (UX), 55-110 hours (UI).</li>\r\n<li>Small projects: 30-45 hours (UX), 25-50 (UI).</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n \r\n<p>Additionally, keep in mind that you will obtain the finished product more quickly the better and more frequently you communicate with the development team. That suggests that you should be explicit about your needs and demands.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Let us analyze how much time you need for this stage:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Enterprises: 20-50 hours (technical documentation), 250-500 hours (frontend), 300-600 hours (backend). </li>\r\n<li>Middle-size projects: 12-25 hours (technical documentation), 120-200 hours (frontend), 130-210 hours (backend).</li>\r\n<li>Small projects: 8-10 hours (technical documentation), 70-90 hours (frontend), 80-100 hours (backend).</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>Since developers work on the frontend and backend in parallel, the time error can be 15-20%.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>The development of progressive web apps ends with the QA stage. You must thoroughly test your product for it to work correctly and benefit your users.</p>\r\n \r\n<p>QA experts examine the functionality, accurate operation of each feature, user-friendliness, and other aspects of the application. The design and development team will fix any errors that are detected.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Here is the approximate time you will need to spend on this step:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Enterprises: 80 hours.</li>\r\n<li>Middle-size projects: 40-80 hours.</li>\r\n<li>Small projects: 40 hours.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<h6>Cost of a Progressive Web App: Let\'s Calculate Your Project</h6>\r\n \r\n \r\n<p>Let\'s now examine the fundamental procedures you must follow to create a progressive web application and accurately calculate your project.</p>\r\n \r\n<h6>Create a design brief for your project.</h6>\r\n<p>Writing a design specification is crucial because it improves the likelihood that the project will succeed. Detailed descriptions of the desired product are included in the design specification (how it should work and how users should interact with it).</p>\r\n \r\n<p>You will save time and money by clearly defining all the important details. The design specification will aid the web design and development team in ensuring that nothing is missed and that the final result properly satisfies your business objectives.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If you have never developed a design specification and are not an expert in product management, you can read our most current post.</p>\r\n \r\n<p>You will learn the fundamentals of drafting specs from this fast guide. You will also discover a sample design specification document based on a recent project we completed.</p>\r\n \r\n<h6>Describe the contractor\'s fundamental requirements.</h6>\r\n<p>Specify the fundamental needs and project objectives. A decent project won\'t succeed if you don\'t have a clear understanding of the results you want. Therefore, the primary task must be properly formulated. The project\'s work should be completed following the precise terms of reference.</p>\r\n \r\n<h6>Requirements ought to be founded on.</h6>\r\n\r\n<p>The size, complexity, technical features, required functionality, country of origin, and prior expertise of the contractor, as well as the model you\'ll use for collaboration, of your project.</p>\r\n<p>It will be simpler for you to maintain control over the quality of the work if you put your contractor\'s essential criteria in writing. As a result, you won\'t waste your money because the contractor has total freedom as a result of the lack of requirements, which will produce an unfavorable result.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<h6>Pick the most effective kind of cooperation.</h6>\r\n<p>You can often select between two models of cooperation. Either a set rate or hourly pay is acceptable. Hourly agreements allow for a more precise estimation of the cost of services and have more lenient terms. Under these circumstances, the contractor can make changes and move to the agile development method.</p>\r\n \r\n<p>Like in earlier instances, the fixed rate is based on the developer\'s hourly rate. The contract, however, details how many hours each week the coders must work.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As a result, the project manager can guarantee that the contractor will be accessible, for instance, for 20 hours per week for 10 weeks. It turns out that the developer must devote the allotted time to developing a product, regardless of the situation.</p>\r\n \r\n<h6>Determine the rough cost based on the typical lead time and your requirements.</h6>\r\n<p>Let\'s first determine the lead time to estimate the cost. Lead time is the amount of time that passes during any particular procedure from beginning to end. The amount of time you should spend on each step of the progressive web application development process has already been mentioned above.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As a result, you won\'t have any trouble figuring out the lead time. The lead time and your requirements will have a significant impact on the approximate cost of finishing your project. As we previously stated, the price goes more the more needs you have and vice versa.</p>\r\n \r\n<h6>Ask prospective contractors</h6>\r\n<p>You must choose several organizations that meet your needs and submit your request to them to get the appropriate contractor. Remember that your request needs to be well-written and should include all of the details that are important to you. How carefully you formulate your request will affect how well businesses comprehend your concepts, requirements, preferences, etc.</p>\r\n\r\n<h6>Examine offerings and select the finest ones.</h6>\r\n<p>It can be difficult to choose the ideal contractor for you and your project. However, after conducting thorough research of the market and contrasting the conditions of work, you may select the alternative that is both best for you and reasonably priced.</p>\r\n\r\n<h6>How much does it cost to develop a progressive web app?</h6>\r\n<p>The price of developing a progressive web application relies on many factors. The cost to construct a website and an app varies depending on the location of the contractor, their level of experience, and the tech stack they use, which we will go into more detail about in the last section of the article.</p>\r\n \r\n<h6>Average costs by nation</h6>\r\n\r\n<p>Think about bringing in a group from Eastern Europe. With more than a million highly skilled developers, this area has expanded into one of the largest IT outsourcing hubs in the world. Its main outsourcing locations are in Ukraine, Poland, Romania, and Belarus, with typical offshore development costs falling between $20 and $50.</p>\r\n \r\n<p>Eastern European construction expenses are affordable, and the quality is encouraging. This area has a strong and well-established IT competency because of the large number of technical educational institutes there. The comparatively high level of language proficiency in Eastern Europe, where the majority of contractors understand English, is another benefit of outsourcing IT services there.</p>\r\n \r\n<p>Let\'s examine the costs in several regions to confirm that Eastern Europe is the most profitable choice:</p>\r\n<table class=\"table\">\r\n    <thead>\r\n      <tr>\r\n        <th>Region</th>\r\n        <th>Project Management</th>\r\n        <th>UI/UX</th>\r\n        <th>QA</th>\r\n        <th>Development </th>\r\n        </tr>\r\n    </thead>\r\n    <tbody>\r\n      <tr>\r\n        <td>Eastern Europe</td>\r\n        <td>$35-60/hr</td>\r\n        <td>$35-60/hr</td>\r\n        <td>$25-50/hr</td>\r\n        <td>$30-80/hr</td>  \r\n      </tr>\r\n         <tr>\r\n        <td>Western Europe</td>\r\n        <td>$45-90/hr</td>\r\n        <td>$45-100/hr</td>\r\n        <td>$30-65/hr</td>  \r\n        <td>$55-100/hr</td>\r\n      </tr>\r\n         <tr>\r\n        <td>America</td>\r\n        <td>$25-55/hr</td>\r\n        <td><$45/hr</td>\r\n        <td>$20-40/hr</td>\r\n        <td>$25-55/hr</td>  \r\n      </tr>\r\n         <tr>\r\n        <td>Asia</td>\r\n        <td>$15-25/hr</td>\r\n        <td><$40/hr</td>\r\n        <td><$30/hr </td>\r\n        <td><$45/hr</td>  \r\n      </tr>\r\n    </tbody>\r\n  </table>\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>You should also remember that with an increase in the team experience level, the price will increase by about 15-25%, regardless of the contractor’s country.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<h6>Typical costs based on seniority</h6>\r\n<p>This place is all about simplicity. The typical cost to design an app increases with the amount of experience the experts have in the sector. Education has an impact on developers\' experience as well.</p>\r\n \r\n<p>Junior teams typically bill in the neighborhood of $20 per hour, but contrary to popular belief, the work will not be done to the highest standard. Senior teams charge roughly $40, while middle-level teams charge $25. In this scenario, you\'ll receive a fantastic product, and the work will be completed with adequate quality.</p>\r\n \r\n<p>For instance, about 35K tech specialists graduate from Ukrainian technical universities each year. The majority of software engineers in Ukraine have bachelor\'s degrees and are fluent in intermediate to advanced English.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>However, having a lot of experience and a good education does not always come at a high cost. As we\'ve previously mentioned, Eastern Europe provides high-quality services at affordable costs.</p>\r\n \r\n<h6>Prices on a scale of Tech Stack</h6>\r\n<p>The team will employ will determine the typical cost to develop an app. Developers frequently ask themselves, \"How much does it cost to construct a simple app?\"</p>\r\n \r\n<p>What is the price of creating a software application? What is the price of developing a SaaS platform? etc. Typically, they will respond, \"That depends on the tech stack used.\" Let\'s look at the costs of various stack utilisation for various regions:</p>\r\n<table class=\"table\">\r\n    <thead>\r\n      <tr>\r\n        <th>Tech stack</th>\r\n        <th>Eastern Europe</th>\r\n        <th>Western Europe</th>\r\n        <th>South America</th>\r\n        <th>Asia </th>\r\n        </tr>\r\n    </thead>\r\n    <tbody>\r\n      <tr>\r\n        <td>Angular</td>\r\n        <td>$35-45/hr</td>\r\n        <td>$40-60/hr</td>\r\n        <td>$40-45/hr</td>\r\n        <td>$25-35/hr</td>  \r\n      </tr>\r\n         <tr>\r\n        <td>React.js</td>\r\n        <td>$40-50/hr</td>\r\n        <td>$50-60/hr</td>\r\n        <td>$30-40/hr</td>  \r\n        <td>$25-40/hr</td>\r\n      </tr>\r\n         <tr>\r\n        <td>PHP</td>\r\n        <td>$40-40/hr</td>\r\n        <td>$40-50/hr</td>\r\n        <td><$40/hr</td>\r\n        <td><$35/hr</td>  \r\n      </tr>\r\n         <tr>\r\n        <td>Node.js</td>\r\n        <td>$40-50/hr</td>\r\n        <td>$45-65/hr</td>\r\n        <td><$40/hr </td>\r\n        <td><$40/hr </td>  \r\n      </tr>\r\n         <tr>\r\n        <td>Laravel</td>\r\n        <td>$40-50/hr</td>\r\n        <td>$40-60/hr</td>\r\n        <td><$40/hr</td>\r\n        <td><$35/hr</td>  \r\n      </tr>\r\n    </tbody>\r\n  </table>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<h6>What are the principal advantages of utilizing Progressive Web App?</h6>\r\n<p>The basic distinctions between PWAs and other application types have already been covered, along with some PWA benefits and drawbacks. Let\'s now explore how developing progressive web apps can help small and medium-sized organizations.</p>\r\n \r\n<h6>Advantages for new and small businesses</h6>\r\n<p>Progressive web applications have several advantages for startups and small organizations, despite certain limitations.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The following are key advantages for new and small businesses:</p>\r\n <ul>\r\n<li>Progressive web applications work on any system. As a result, you no longer need to make separate investments in developing solutions for each platform. This means cost savings and the ability to reach as many users as possible, regardless of the devices they use.</li>\r\n<li>Instant installation and little room needed. As we mentioned previously, many smartphone owners refuse to install the program because of the slow download speed or the excessively high space requirement. In practice, this translates to a greater number of installations and users.</li>\r\n<li>It takes less time to create a progressive web application than it does to create a standard website. As a result, you may immediately test your hypothesis and obtain the first results.</li>\r\n<li>Compared to other application types, developing progressive web apps is significantly less expensive.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>The following are key advantages for mid-level and enterprise organizations:</p>\r\n<p>Any size and type of business can benefit from the progressive web application as a solution. </p>\r\n\r\n<h6>Let\'s examine the advantages of PWAs for medium-sized and large businesses.</h6>\r\n\r\n<p>The following are key advantages for middle- and enterprise-level businesses:</p>\r\n <ul>\r\n<li>You automatically enter a region with less competition. When you develop a mobile app for your company, you automatically join the two million iOS and Android apps that have already been developed. The ability to navigate from social media pages or search results is supported by progressive web apps.

(107, 20, 'DotOxygen', '01.06.2020', 'UIUX Design Trends for 2020', ' <p>Despite a poor start, this year has offered many fascinating UI/UX design developments. Some of them might be known to you already, while others may be brand-new. Nevertheless, each one of them deserves your careful attention. Start now! </p>\r\n \r\n<h5>UX design</h5>\r\n \r\n <p>This year, it was very popular to improve user interaction and experience using sound. Sometimes music may change the game and make the user\'s trip enjoyable. If this technique is used properly, it enhances the visual appeal of a website and even draws attention to the key elements of the design. </p>\r\n <p>It is important to note, however, that auto-play music on websites is frequently viewed negatively, making audio user experience design a rather contentious topic. Most of the time, when you leisurely browse through web pages, you don\'t anticipate hearing any sound unless you specifically switched it on. Any unexpected sound could be upsetting and even distracting if the user is not prepared for it. This new UI design approach should be applied carefully because of this. </p>\r\n \r\n <p>However, Audio UX Design is undeniably popular and can even accomplish a good goal. To meet the demands of users with visual impairment, the design that incorporates music is highly beneficial. Sound effects can make navigation easier, improving technology. </p>\r\n\r\n<h6> Using White Space</h6>\r\n \r\n <p>Even a decent UI design might occasionally appear to be a jumble of various components that are all prominently displayed and clamored for attention. In this situation, your CTA or crucial message may be easily overlooked due to the design\'s excess repetition. More vacant space can be left, which has already become a very common solution to this issue. </p>\r\n \r\n <p>According to this design trend, you should give an important element some room if you want users to notice it. The phrase \"give it a lot of space\" would be preferable. You can give it any kind of white space, such as passive or active space, macro or micro space, text, or the first paragraph. </p>\r\n\r\n <p>All you have to do is make sure the highlighted element is worthwhile for users to pay attention to. Otherwise, watch out for a backfire in the form of discontent and waning interest. </p>\r\n \r\n<h6>Gradients of Variable Color</h6>\r\n \r\n <p>You might be thinking that gradients were popular a long time ago and have since achieved their peak and disappeared. Gradients are already seen practically everywhere, and 2020 appears to be beginning to bring some of the earlier UI design ideas back. You may have observed certain stores or supermarkets styled with a gradient technique, as well as clothing and technological equipment since it frequently extends even outside UI/UX design. </p>\r\n\r\n <p>What makes this noteworthy is that gradients aren\'t just making a comeback; the aesthetic itself is changing. Its contemporary expression, in contrast to earlier monotone gradients, blends several hues and has little contrast. As a result, something new is something old that has been forgotten. </p>\r\n \r\n<h6>Ongoing user Experience</h6>\r\n \r\n\r\n <p>Numerous interruptions are perhaps the worst feature that 99 percent of interfaces have by default and that significantly detracts from the user experience. Do you want to see that image? Please visit the other website and wait for the image to load in a pop-out window. Want to review a product\'s attractive qualities? </p>\r\n <p>Once it has loaded, click the attributes section. The list is extensive, and many more things prevent users from reaching the desired aim. In this way, the very goal of a continuous UX trend is to do away with any hiccup when utilizing technology and, in the process, become the best design of all contemporary UIs. </p>\r\n\r\n <p>Consider how a user, would purchase a product online to gain a better understanding of how it operates. Jeff is trying to find a new bike. He is highly knowledgeable about bikes, so after selecting the first one he likes, Jeff immediately hits the Characteristics section to view the brand, weight, and speed ranges. He observes how the traits displayed on the right side of the screen right away. No additional tabs or pop-up windows are required. User reviews are shown next to the qualities after he clicks the Reviews section. Then, Jeff wants to slightly adjust the bike\'s appearance by changing the color and possibly adding new wheels or a handlebar. However, once more, there are no additional tabs and no pop-up windows; rather, a specific portion of the image changes right away on the same page. As a result, Jeff is constantly fixated on his favorite bike. </p>\r\n \r\n <p>As you can see, Jeff has no chance of rebounding, which is what I mean by an effective design. Even while implementing a continuous user experience may be challenging, it is worthwhile. </p>\r\n\r\n<h6> Split Screen Asymmetrical</h6>\r\n \r\n \r\n <p>Undoubtedly, a web page\'s symmetrical block structure appeals to the viewer\'s eye and aids in the assimilation of textual information. It\'s perfect in every way, but what\'s the matter? That is very monotonous. Fortunately, current UI design trends demonstrate that we humans have an innate affinity for asymmetry. </p>\r\n \r\n <p>The manifestation of this desire, which is growing in popularity this year, is the asymmetrical split screen. This style enables the creation of true UI design masterpieces by fusing both graphical and textual elements in a disorganized yet engaging parallel. The asymmetrical split-screen design may transform a web page into a work of art in the proper hands. </p>\r\n\r\n <p>Modern wide displays that enable viewing the full complexity of the page structure look especially fantastic when using samples of this style. </p>\r\n \r\n<h6>Neomorphism</h6>\r\n \r\n \r\n <p>Skeuomorphism first debuted quite some time ago, but it never really took off. This design style suggests that some interface elements replicate or imitate their actual equivalents, either in terms of how they seem or how a user might interact with them. Skeuomorphism, however, underwent a transition in late 2019 and is prepared to finalize the UI design this year. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>Jason Kelley and Alexander Pluto created Neumorphism, also known as New Skeuomorphism, which adopts the same methodology as its predecessor but with a more understated aesthetic. Neumorphism allows you to transform a CTA button into a 3D-like element using light and shadows, and when you click it, the CTA will be pushed like a typical button in the real world. The interface is highly pleasant and clickable as a result of this effect.</p>\r\n \r\n<p>Even one of our designers produced a brief guide to the Neumorphism style, which spent over a week at the top of the Dribbble charts.</p>\r\n\r\n<h6>Design in Dark Mode</h6>\r\n \r\n<p>There is a valid reason why more and more apps are offering to convert to a dark mode, as you have probably observed. Users adore that option and its attractive design. To make it simpler for them to read lengthy paragraphs, some people even choose dark mode. As a result, a brand-new design methodology known as \"Dark Mode\" design was developed in response to the increasing demand.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The dark design makes everything look incredibly chic and businesslike, demonstrating that it is not for pleasure but business. In addition, the color scheme of this design style makes it very simple to draw attention to the interface\'s most crucial components by employing just lighter hues. If you know what I mean, a black backdrop makes it impossible for a yellow CTA \"Contact Us\" button to be overlooked.</p>\r\n \r\n<h6>Multiple Layers</h6>\r\n \r\n\r\n<p>The layers are so in demand that designers in 2020 even stacked them on top of one another. Fortunately, this overlap produces a rather interesting 3D-like appearance that gives the impression that the web page has several dimensions and depth. It makes sense why overlapping has become one of the most recent UI trends.</p>\r\n \r\n<p>If the overall image maintains visual appeal, overlapping may happen on more than just two layers—it may happen on three, four, or even more. Additionally, you can overlay different interface elements, such as backdrop and content boxes, video frameworks and images, text, and interface elements.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Almost any other design style can be supplemented using an overlapping layer method. Make sure the user attention flow works effectively for you when doing this, though.</p>\r\n \r\n<h6>Modern Animation</h6>\r\n \r\n\r\n<p>This year continues the trend of dynamic and potent animations becoming an essential component of contemporary UX design. You may have observed that today\'s websites frequently transition from static to animated visual representations. Animations may be found all over the place, from the brief animated film at the top of the home page to the quick, light animations of a menu dropdown or different clicking effects.</p>\r\n \r\n<p>Businesses aim to take advantage of the fact that occasionally a compelling short animation can be more powerful than a few pages of text. One sophisticated animation, for instance, can be used to power a whole website and continue while the user scrolls. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>These websites typically require strong technology and an internet connection to function properly, but the impact they have on a user is fantastic. The majority of the time, it will appear that people who did it were professionals (which is accurate) and that it may have cost them a significant sum of money (which is also true).</p>\r\n \r\n<h6>Conclusion</h6>\r\n \r\n<p>So far, those have been some of the most noteworthy design fads. As you may have observed, some of the UI patterns discussed here are updates of earlier trends that took on a fresh look in 2020. There is nothing wrong with that because it is a fairly common occurrence. Every time a certain fashion trend reappears, it gets better, more well-thought-out, and more adapted to the needs of contemporary society.</p>\r\n<p>DotOxygen is available if you require help with UI/UX design.

(108, 21, 'DotOxygen', '30.08.2020', 'User Personas', '<p>In the previous piece, I mentioned that Mr. Alan Cooper allowed me to ask him one question in which he elaborated on his viewpoint, for which I will always be grateful. I wish to tribute this amazing man in this piece once more.</p>\r\n \r\n<p>The outcome, according to Mr. Alan Cooper, would be improved by enhancing empathy for your user in interaction design. Examples are Mac mini/MacBook Air for users who just need to perform light tasks, iMac/MacBook Pro for creators, Mac Studio/Mac Pro for users who need to perform more powerful jobs, etc.</p>\r\n \r\n<p>The outcome of such labor will be a product that no one will require if we concentrate on all users worldwide.</p>\r\n \r\n<p>Everyone will be covered by such a product, while at the same time, It won\'t carry out any of the tasks given to it in a quality manner.</p>\r\n\r\n<h5>Personas come in three varieties:</h5>\r\n \r\n<h6>Marketing mannequin. </h6>\r\n<p>Not appropriate for UX design because they only represent the demographics of the product buyer (customer), not their behavior, objectives, or motivations.</p>\r\n \r\n<p>A prototype (non-empirical persona). This kind of persona is the one with which we start our investigation. In other words, this is a hypothetical portrayal of a future user that is based solely on team assumptions and is not supported by the study\'s findings.</p>\r\n \r\n<p>It\'s important to note that this kind of persona is just employed to envision the product\'s target market. A proto-persona will be created as a result of our presentation. We can discover and interview potential customers, perform an online poll with the aid of a proto-persona, and, depending on the qualitative data, create an empirical character that can be used going forward.</p>\r\n\r\n<h6>A persona (Empirical persona).</h6> \r\n<p>This kind of persona is exactly what we require. In other words, this is the researcher\'s interpretation of the target audience, which shares certain behaviors, objectives, and motivations.</p>\r\n<p>A user persona is a simplified representation of your target market\'s common behaviors, objectives, motivations, needs, and concerns.</p>\r\n \r\n<p>You should also be aware of the distinction between a role and a user persona:</p>\r\n \r\n<h6>Role.</h6> \r\n<p>Depending on the functionality needed and access. In other words, this is a subset of system users who are connected by a shared set of access privileges.\r\nPersona. It is constructed using reasons, objectives, and issues.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The following roles are present in Preply, in my opinion:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Super Admin</li>\r\n<li>Admin</li>\r\n<li>Help Desk</li>\r\n<li>Teacher</li>\r\n<li>Student</li>\r\n </ul>\r\n<p>Take the position of a student as a starting point. They could perhaps identify the following 4 personas as a consequence of a user interview:</p>\r\n <ul>\r\n<li>A student who wants to study English from scratch up to a strong conversational level but does not speak the language.</li>\r\n<li>A student who has studied English before has a foundational understanding and wants to advance. </li>\r\n<li>A student who is proficient in the language at the B2 level and desires to learn the business language for career-related reasons. </li>\r\n<li>A student who wishes to lose their accent and speaks C1/C2 in that language.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>Similar behaviors, objectives, motives, desires, and worries bind each of these personalities together.</p>\r\n \r\n<p>Here are several definitions you should be familiar with because they are frequently used:</p>\r\n \r\nArchetype and persona. \r\n<p>Since they both include the same data and information regarding user behavior, relationships, goals, and pain points, they are functionally equivalent. A user persona has a photo, a name, and a biography, but a user archetype is not connected to particular names or faces.</p>\r\n<p>Example of a language-learning archetype for users</p>\r\n \r\n<p>A client is a person who pays a professional, business, or organization for their services or guidance (consultations). Long-lasting, more intimate professional relationships and personalization are characteristics of the client, meaning you can work with clients for years while maintaining a special relationship and taking a personalized approach to solving their problems.</p>\r\n \r\n<p>Personalization, often known as customization, is the process by which a user alters a website\'s user interface, an operating system, or tangible objects (such as a desktop) to suit their individual preferences.</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>A customer is someone who enters a physical location or an online store to make a purchase. Frequently, there is a one-time transaction without the development of a lasting relationship. This is only a business, in which money is exchanged for goods and services.</li>\r\n<li>A customer is a person who has purchased or will subsequently use your good or service. The customer simply needs to use a product or service; he doesn\'t need to purchase it himself. For $4 per month, a business may purchase a specific InVision service plan for a design team. The corporation will assume the role of the customer in this scenario, while the design team will assume the role of the consumer.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>In a marketing strategy, a user is someone who visited your website, interacted with it, and left without placing an order or making an outbound contact. In other words, it did not generate any profit for the business.</p>\r\n\r\n<h6>The user persona\'s objective</h6>\r\n<p>Utilizing this strategy will enable you to hear the story, view the pertinent user experience, and comprehend the aims, desires, needs, and anxieties.</p>\r\n \r\n<h6>Value to the group</h6>\r\n<p>The team will develop greater empathy for their target market and create the ideal solution in this way.</p>\r\n \r\n<h6>Business value</h6>\r\n<p>Understanding users will significantly lower the chance of creating the incorrect product or service in addition to the factors mentioned below.</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Important:</li> \r\n<p>The team will receive incorrect results if the target audience is chosen incorrectly, which could cause the process to go in the wrong direction.</p>\r\n \r\n<li>Time: </li>\r\n<p>Up to 30 minutes for preparation\r\n2 to 5 hours per empirical persona for the main action.</p>\r\n\r\n<li>Making process: </li>\r\n<p>To identify our potential users at the subjective level of the team and stakeholders, find them, and conduct user interviews, we constructed a proto-persona. We have a lot of qualitative data after the user interview that we may utilize to create an empirical persona based on actual data.</p>\r\n </ul>\r\n<h5>Step 1. Demographics</h5>\r\n \r\n<p>Enter only the information that is necessary, such as your name, age, city, country, level of education, and line of employment. all of this. Don\'t add anything new, make the persona prettier, or transform it into a marketing persona by adding more product customer demographics.</p>\r\n \r\n<h6>Customer user</h6> \r\n<p>We are not searching for an artifact that will be used to increase sales and a profit strategy. Our objective is to enhance the user experience.</p>\r\n\r\n<h5>Step 2. The narrative</h5>\r\n<p>This section is often known as the biography or background.</p>\r\n \r\n \r\n<p>If you\'ve already completed an Empathy Map, you can transfer the existing data into the user persona. However, I suggest having a team discussion about all the blocks to see if you can add anything new.</p>\r\n \r\n<p>Although \"a day in the life\" stories is OK, they don\'t address user involvement. The mental model itself is based on information gathered through a qualitative study method known as a user interview.</p>\r\n \r\n<p>A mental model is a personal, subjective experience that may not accurately represent reality and simply represents a person\'s attitude toward things and processes. Furthermore, various people may have distinct mental models.</p>\r\n<p>You can later use the mental model as a story frame for the section on expectations.</p>\r\n \r\n<p>Why is it crucial to recognize your respondents\' mental models? In the end, there are two possible course developments for the events:</p>\r\n \r\n<p>Play the game \"Battle of Psychics\" and have fun with your teammates while pondering what John would do.</p>\r\n \r\n<p>Alternatively, you may quiz respondents on how they picture using a potential product or service.</p>\r\n \r\n<h5>Step 3. User objectives</h5>\r\n \r\n<p>Add the objectives of the respondents you spoke with first. Mr. Alan Cooper categorizes them into 3 categories:</p>\r\n<p>\"Experience goals\" are the driving force. This phrase is also used in forensics, and it enables you to ascertain the motivations behind a criminal act. Ideally, there is just one extremely broad motive. Take the goal for professional self-development as an example.\r\n<p>Motive is the most powerful internal force that propels a person to take action. It\'s a great motivator, then.</p>\r\n<p>\"Life goals\" are objectives. Motive leads to goals. Why would a person use your product or service, ask the question. If you carefully examine the respondent\'s responses, you will undoubtedly discover at least 3–5 goals.</p>\r\n<p>In other words, if the user\'s motivation is the desire for professional self-development, then the goals will be: earn a high salary, buy a house for your family, consume only the best foods, use name-brand appliances, spend time with your family twice a year relaxing abroad, etc.</p>\r\n \r\n<p>\"End goals\" are tasks. Goals lead to objectives. To accomplish the aims, the user must perform these particular tasks. That means that 1 goal = several tasks. Asking yourself \"How can the user attain his goals?\" will help you identify a task.</p>\r\n \r\n<p>This indicates that if the user wants to earn a big wage, their job will be to locate a list of all the necessary approaches online, evaluate their value and efficacy, and implement any necessary changes.</p>\r\n\r\n<h5>Step 4. Recognize the wants, needs, and anxieties</h5>\r\n\r\n<h6>Needs </h6>\r\n<p>These are the commercial factors that assist the user in achieving their objectives. After we identified the insights and transformed them into needs, I carry them over from the empathy map.\r\nFor instance, a reasonable tuition charge, real-time interaction with mentors, ongoing mentor feedback, and a certificate.</p>\r\n \r\n<h6>Wants (external environment) </h6>\r\n<p>This block is often referred to as drivers or motivations. In other words, this is anything that will increase the enjoyment of accomplishing user goals or motivate them to perform the initial or subsequent stages.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For instance, our consumer wants to obtain all of their requirements logically and from a single trustworthy source.</p>\r\n \r\n<h6>Fears </h6>\r\n<p>This roadblock is also known as risks or frustrations. In other words, this is the worst possible scenario for a user or a significant phobia.</p>\r\n \r\n<p>For instance, a person can be scared because he discovered several, disparate articles online. Our user is unaware of what should be taught to him initially and what he shouldn\'t learn at all. He worries about the information\'s quality and the best way to present it logically. His uncertainty about his ability to learn presents a significant obstacle.</p>\r\n\r\n<h5>Step 5. Expectations</h5>\r\n<p>This block has already been mentioned. In other words, you must adapt the mental model into a narrative frame.</p>\r\n <ul>\r\n<li>Consider your options, then select one main objective. </li>\r\n<li>Your chosen target should have several objectives.</li>\r\n<li>We walk you through each step.</li>\r\n </ul>\r\n<p>In other words, a story is more detailed than a use case, which is essentially a long list of actions the user can do to accomplish their goal.</p>\r\n \r\n<p>To create personas, choose from the following resources: Google Docs, Xtensio, Userforge, UXPressia, or Miro.</p>\r\n', '797827-user_persona.jpg', 'Branding, Website Design, Website Development, User Interface, User Experience', '2030-08-20 19:00:00.00000', '30.08.2020'),
(109, 22, 'DotOxygen', '28.05.2022', 'Using Micro-Interactions To Drive UX', '<p>Micro-interaction effectively creates a brand\'s ethos and personality while forging close relationships with your customers. A smooth and engaging user experience is made possible by these little but effective habit-forming elements. The two most well-known instances of micro-interactions are Facebook \"likes\" and Tinder \"swipes.\"</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Micro-interactions were initially needed to assist consumers who were having trouble using a service or product. Through comments and gentle assurance, the major goal was to help clients become more product knowledgeable.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Micro-interaction can provide clients with visual rewards once the work is finished in addition to hints, comments, and recommendations. Let\'s get a thorough understanding of how micro-interactions might benefit your website or app and improve the user experience.</p>\r\n\r\n<h6>Procedure for Micro-Interactions</h6>\r\n<p>A straightforward micro-interaction has four structural components. They consist of loops, feedback, rules, and triggers. Every micro-interaction has a crucial component that helps to structure the operational cycle. Because it allows for feedback and runs, users can see how their performance is doing and get more motivated as a consequence.</p>\r\n\r\n<h6>Triggers</h6>\r\n<p>The trigger is a feature that starts both user-initiated micro-interactions, or those that are prompted by users, and system-initiated micro-interactions, or those that are driven by the system. For instance, user triggers like scroll, tap, click, swipe, and pull are often used. Such activities as ordering a cab, paying for anything, selecting something from a menu, etc. fall under this category. On the other hand, an alert is a prime example of a system-generated prompt.</p>\r\n\r\n<h6>Rules</h6>\r\n<p>By setting a prompt into motion, this feature determines what occurs when a user taps, scrolls, clicks, or swipes. Apps utilize rules to determine the triggers users use. One example of this is the \"swipe\" function on Tinder. Users continue to follow these principles while often using the program, developing them into habits over time.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<h6>Feedback</h6>\r\n<p>The user is now informed by the system via visual, aural, or tactile signals. Users are simply engaged by this feature, which encourages them to carry on with the procedure. As an illustration, consider how steps are represented visually, how a download is progressing, or how the success or failure of payment is signaled visually, tactilely, or audibly. All of them point to the feedback mechanism.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<h6>Loop/Modes</h6>\r\n<p>This is the last step, which consists of the process\' meta-rules and determines both the frequency and length. For instance, the \"Buy Now\" button on an eCommerce app gets changed to \"Buy Another.\" Such loops are often used by the app to re-engage consumers before they stop using it.</p>\r\n\r\n<h6>How Should Micro-Interactions Be Used?</h6>\r\n<p>Although every UX interaction on your website or app doesn\'t require a micro-interaction throughout the wireframe, we all agree that they are fantastic. Because excessive usage of this tool might dilute the overall site design experience. The information hierarchy could even get muddled in the worst-case circumstances. The user may feel uneasy and irritable as a result of how it subverts the design and influences the user experience. Therefore, it\'s crucial to understand when and how to employ them.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Here are a few brief recommendations for enhancing your mobile user experience using micro-interactions:</p>\r\n<h6>Swipe left or right</h6>\r\n<p>This little maneuver is a distinctive one that relies just on swiping. On the Tinder app, it is the center of attention. This is because swiping is simpler than tapping or clicking.</p>\r\n\r\n<h6>Buttons that prompt action</h6>\r\n<p>The user feels a feeling of urgency as a result of this micro-interaction. Put a \"Confirm order\" or \"Book Now\" prompt, for instance. Acting on such urges so seems like a little accomplishment.</p>\r\n\r\n<h6>System Situation</h6>\r\n<p>Users of your app can see they are heading in the correct route thanks to the system status. It aids in keeping things clear. Users might occasionally become frustrated while filling out forms, downloading documents, uploading images, etc.</p>\r\n\r\n<h6>Simple Notifications</h6>\r\n<p>The users have a short attention span and just require a fast reminder of the chosen or wishlist items in their abandoned basket. A little notice can persuade them to complete the transaction.</p>\r\n\r\n<h6>Animated Buttons</h6>\r\n<p>Animated buttons are so adorable. Additionally, they provide quick app navigation for consumers. To design appealing animation and interesting buttons that come up when hovered over or touched on, you may use appealing colors, shapes, sizes, typefaces, and clipart components.</p>\r\n\r\n<h6>Animated Text Inputs</h6>\r\n<p>An easy-to-like feature, such as the ability to zoom in when entering credit card information or filling out a form, can improve the user experience.</p>\r\n\r\n<h6>Reward for Success</h6>\r\n<p>For health and education apps, in particular, this is advantageous. Users are encouraged to connect with the app more through micro-interactions that reward them for achieving little and significant milestones with a badge or commendation.</p>\r\n\r\n<h6>Micro-Interactions provide advantages</h6>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Outstanding brand communication</li>\r\n<p>Micro-interactions may be utilized to clearly explain a process to consumers and assist in converting them into customers in a fun, easy, and convenient way. This aids in your brand\'s strong image recognition.</p>\r\n<li>Increased User Engagement</li>\r\n<p>Micro-interactions, in the opinion of experts, improve user engagement. These little components subtly encourage people to participate and interact.</p>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h6>Excellent User Experience</h6>\r\n<p>From banking to shopping to studying to traveling to maintaining one\'s health, there is an app for everything. The entire user experience is enhanced by a vast array of activities.</p>\r\n\r\n<h6>Quick Response</h6>\r\n<p>Being unaware of what\'s going on behind the scenes may be incredibly stressful, especially when making a purchase. An incredible user experience is aided by instant feedback via auditory, visual, or even vibrating notifications.</p>\r\n\r\n<h6>Visual Harmony</h6>\r\n<p>The overall attractiveness of UX design includes micro-interaction such as touch, swipe, scroll, or even typing. Therefore, to create a compelling app or website, UX designers must keep all these factors in mind.</p>\r\n\r\n<h6>Best Practices for Micro-Interactions in the Industry</h6>\r\n<p><b>KISS (keep it simple, stupid) (KISS)</b></p>\r\n<p>The well-known design tenet of KISS is even more crucial when it comes to micro-interactions. The ultimate objective is to provide a positive user experience while avoiding user distraction.</p>\r\n\r\n<h6>Short is better</h6>\r\n<p>The term \"micro\" appears in the name itself. Micro-interactions, however, are not necessarily meant to be a deal-breaker. Long micro-interactions are another factor in user distraction.</p>\r\n\r\n<h6>Correct Location, Correct Engagement</h6>\r\n<p>Before deciding where to put micro-interactions, you must weigh your possibilities. The widespread usage of micro-interaction designs has a purpose. It is secure for you to keep utilizing them because they have previously received approval from several specialists. Additionally, the way you employ micro interaction should be consistent with your brand values.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<h6>Wrapping Up </h6>\r\n<p>UX designers have a significant influence on the overall look and feel of applications and websites, user experience, the customer journey, how customers engage with the product or service, how they feel about the brand, how they shop, and much more. In the end, you want users to feel a connection to your business, adore your goods and services, have a seamless user experience and come back to your website or app in the future.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>After all, your goal is to gain the loyalty and trust of your consumers.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n', '734172-using_micro_inter_actions_to_drive_ux.jpg', 'Branding, Website Design, Website Development, User Interface, User Experience', '2030-08-20 19:00:00.00000', '30.08.2020'),
(110, 24, 'DotOxygen', '27.07.2022', 'UX Design Deliverables from DotOxygen', '<p>As a prominent Interface design firm, we\'re frequently asked the following questions by potential clients and other designers: </p>\r\n<h6>\"At the end of a design project, what deliverables do you provide?\" </h6>\r\n<h6>\"Will our development team be able to carry it out?\" </h6>\r\n<h6>\"Will your designs be able to be maintained by our design team?\" </h6>\r\n<h6>\"How difficult will it be in the future to add additional features?\" </h6>\r\netc. \r\n<p>To answer all of these concerns and provide insight into our design process, we\'ve included a brief overview of each deliverable and its function. </p>\r\n<h6>What is the definition of a UX deliverable? </h6>\r\n<p>Let\'s start from the beginning: what exactly is a deliverable? A UX deliverable, to put it simply, is a design document that communicates ideas, and research findings, and gives recommendations to design and development teams. The list of deliverables for a conventional UX design project is more or less the same, regardless of industry or platform, and depends mostly on the product requirements, budget, and timetable. </p>\r\n<p>This list at DotOxgen generally includes the following documents: </p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Phase of study</li>\r\n<li>Takeaways from user research </li>\r\n<li>Document on UI/UX research </li>\r\n<li>The phase of user experience design </li>\r\n<li>Mind map of information architecture </li>\r\n<li>A document describing the user flow </li>\r\n<li>Wireframes </li>\r\n<li>The prototype is interactive</li>\r\n<li>Report on user testing </li>\r\n<li>The phase of UI design </li>\r\n<li>Mockups for visual design </li>\r\n<li>Animations in the user interface </li>\r\n<li>System of design </li>\r\n<li>Specifications for design</li> \r\n</ul>\r\n<p>Let\'s take a closer look at each of them individually now: </p>\r\n<h6>Takeaways from user research </h6>\r\n<p>Any project should have user research as a component. We acquire more insights into the consumers\' demands, emotions, behavior, and motivation by using various approaches such as individual interviews, field research, and internet surveys. Apart from conducting interviews, we also engage in activities such as card sorting, thought mapping, collaborative wireframing, and so on. The primary findings, personas, and high-level suggestions from these interviews and activities are summarised in a takeaways paper. This document aids in gaining buy-in from key stakeholders on user goals and desired functionality. </p>\r\n<h6>Document on UI/UX research </h6>\r\n<p>Competitive research is a useful technique for identifying the strengths and weaknesses of rivals. Typically, we choose 5-7 of the most interesting direct competitors and assess their solutions to challenges and concerns discovered during user research and project discovery. We also take notice of their terminology to ensure that our solution follows industry best practices in terms of language and naming rules.</p> \r\n<p>However, we don\'t stop there; we continue to look at things that aren\'t directly relevant to the project. After all, the end-user experience is far more varied and not restricted to a particular product. We could look at topics like navigation, onboarding, the most prevalent processes, and design patterns, the sorts of visualizations utilized, and so on throughout the research phase. As a consequence, we generate a final takeaways document that incorporates the key findings and serves as a guidebook to guide and support our design decisions throughout the project. </p>\r\n<h6>The structure of information </h6>\r\n<p>We utilize all of the acquired data to develop an information architecture for the upcoming product or change the existing one to better meet the customers\' demands and workflows once the main research phase is over. It\'s commonly done in the form of a mind map, which provides a bird\'s eye view of the system and illustrates the links between its components. When done in\r\npartnership with stakeholders, this mind map exercise has proven to be quite beneficial. It is simpler to grasp the scope and establish feature priorities when the full project structure is shown. The mind map allows us to plan design work more precisely, arrange material in a more effective and long-term manner, and build more well-thought-out navigation. We experimented with a variety of online and offline programs to construct mind maps throughout the years, finally settling on MindNode as our preferred tool. </p>\r\n<h6>The document describing the user flow </h6>\r\n<p>A user flow is a set of user activities or systems that a user must go through to accomplish a certain objective. We make it in a design-specification style that blends screen layouts with a flowchart-like description of user and system interactions broken down into small situations. This document\'s major objective is to give developers a complete explanation of all conceivable user flows, including edge situations, mistakes, and varied states. It\'s a live document that we keep up to date during the life of a project. Empty rectangles and arrows that outline fundamental workflows are the starting point. </p>\r\n<p>A user flow is a sequence of actions or system states that the user must complete. We add the first wireframes to the document as soon as we obtain them and update them with final visuals once the visual design production process has begun. </p>\r\n<p>This method helps us to iterate on user flows more quickly, keep track of the project\'s progress based on the document\'s completeness, and spot any annoying or unclear spots early on. </p>\r\n<h6>Wireframes </h6>\r\n<p>Wireframes are the skeleton framework for a website or application. They\'re made to outline core layouts, UX procedures, and content while also solidifying project requirements. They\'re simple to build and maintain, allowing us to swiftly iterate on concepts and gather input from stakeholders and end users. </p>\r\n<p>The question of whether to develop low-fidelity or high-fidelity wireframes is a never-ending discussion in the design world. Both sides have valid points of contention, but we prefer the latter. Stakeholders and users, in our experience, have a better understanding of them. When the wireframe is more complex and seems more like a final product rather than a sketch, we don\'t have to explain that \"this grey block will be changed with a copy later,\" and a lot of questions are handled by ourselves. </p>\r\n<p>Low-fidelity wireframes, on the other hand, proved to be more efficient at the outset of the UX process, when we were just starting to work on general layout and navigation. We can rapidly build a set of possibilities for the client to consider, and after we agree on a solution, we move on to high-fidelity wireframes, which take longer to create but are more helpful to the project in the long term. </p>\r\n<h6>Interactive prototype </h6>\r\n<p>It is said that a picture is worth a thousand words. An interactive prototype is worth ten times more than a static prototype. As part of the wireframing and graphic design processes, we produce interactive prototypes. They assist us in identifying design flaws, iterating on designs internally, validating assumptions, and testing hypotheses. We frequently employ basic technologies such as InVision. It has a wide range of features for conducting user testing\r\nsessions, presenting our work to clients, and collecting stakeholder input. We may use something like Framer or develop the prototype directly in HTML/CSS to test a more complicated interaction or workflow. </p>\r\n<h6>User feedback report </h6>\r\n<p>Making stops along the route to confirm assumptions and design decisions is always beneficial while working on a design project. A usability test is one of these pauses. We execute a series of user testing sessions utilizing an interactive prototype (made using wireframes or final images). We prepare a user testing report as a consequence of this process, which includes a summary of our results and recommendations for the next actions. It also sets the stage for the testing by describing the overarching objectives, setting, and demographics of the participants. Audio and video recordings, as well as other supporting resources, are also shared. </p>\r\n<h6>Mockups for visual design </h6>\r\n<p>We begin working on the visual aspect of the project while we finish the wireframes and processes for the main functionality. We always start with visual research, whether we\'re using branding standards (if they\'re offered) or creating a style from scratch. To show our idea for the product\'s future style, we produce a series of visual design concepts supported by mood boards. </p>\r\n<p>We continue to the production phase when we agree on the direction — applying the styling to all relevant pages and producing all necessary specs so developers can begin working on their side of the project. </p>\r\n<h6>UI animations </h6>\r\n<p>We also produce short video clips illustrating the primary UI interactions and animations as part of the production phase, which adds joyful moments to the user experience and helps users along the way. Developers utilize the films and animation requirements as a reference to build these interactions into the final product. </p>\r\n<h6>Design System</h6> \r\n<p>A design system is a series of design-specification papers that may be used by customers\' internal design teams or third-party firms as a strong toolbox. </p>\r\n<p>The style guide formalizes fundamental design ideas, defines visual identity, and establishes ground rules for typography, colors, responsive behavior, product photography, and visualizations. </p>\r\n<p>A library of components is a collection of UI elements in various states. It might be in the form of a Sketch file or any other program required for the project. </p>\r\n<p>The UX guidelines paper contains navigation advice, as well as descriptions of commonly used UX design patterns and how to utilize them with the components library. </p>\r\n<p>The design system is used to keep the product\'s appearance and experience consistent, as well as to construct new pages and add new features. </p>\r\n<h6>Specifications for design</h6>\r\n<p>When it comes to development, it\'s critical to ensure that the design is carried out correctly. Often, developers willfully or involuntarily overlook little details that may not appear to be significant, but even minor differences in design and execution can have a snowball effect, affecting the final user experience significantly. </p>\r\n<p>Previously, our team would give a thorough, static PDF document describing all UI component\'s dimensions, margins, paddings, and so forth. Due to numerous design revisions during the project, the creation of this document took a long time and was difficult to maintain. Developers regularly complained about how difficult it was to rapidly locate important information and navigate through the text in general.</p>\r\n', '42505-ux_design_deliverables_from_dotoxygen.jpg', 'Branding, Website Design, Website Development, User Interface, User Experience', '2027-07-20 21:00:00.00000', '27.07.2022'),
(111, 27, 'DotOxygen', '11.08.2022', 'Why Quality Assurance is Important, and What are Its Benefits', '<p>Testing a few lines of code is only one aspect of quality assurance (QA). It is a way to produce a product that will not only be reliable and free of bugs but also adhere to the specifications at first and enhance the user experience.</p>\r\n \r\n<h4>What Is the Difference Between Software Testing, QA, and QC?</h4>\r\n \r\n<p>When the development stage is in progress, quality assurance is the process of reviewing the software. This process needs to be set up professionally to guarantee the product\'s security and quality. This will enable avoiding many of the issues that typically arise after the release.\r\nQuality Control (QC) and Software Testing are two similar techniques that are frequently confused with quality assurance. In contrast to them, QA encompasses QC and software testing in addition to being a broad notion. What sets them apart is as follows:</p>\r\n\r\n<h6>Quality Assurance</h6>\r\n<p>The assessment of technical requirements and quality standards is the core of quality control. Discovering the departures from the original design is the task. When the project is finished or is almost finished, this phase often occurs right before the release.</p>\r\n \r\n<p>QA is focused on potential future issues as opposed to QC, which is a reactive approach. Because it assists in identifying potential problems and resolving them before they have an unfavorable effect, quality assurance is proactive in this regard.</p>\r\n \r\n<p>QC differs from software testing in that it focuses on the entire product, whereas software testing concentrates on individual code segments as well as UI/UX quality.</p>\r\n<h6>Testing software</h6>\r\n<p>In terms of software testing, it is merely a technique for identifying flaws so that they can be corrected. Software testing, to put it simply, is the process of looking for all kinds of flaws and errors as well as they attempt to break the product to discover how much it can withstand.</p>\r\n \r\n<h5>Software testing can be done manually or automatically.</h5>\r\n\r\n<h6>Automated evaluation</h6>\r\n<p>Software, digital tools, scripts, and other items are tested as part of the automated testing approach to validate and assess the quality of the code. This method contributes to saving human effort and reducing testing time.</p>\r\n<h6>Manual evaluation</h6>\r\n<p>Manual testing, in contrast to automated testing, makes use of human labor to evaluate the product\'s quality.</p>\r\n\r\n<h5>Is QA Necessary for My Project?</h5>\r\n<p>You certainly can. That would be a wonderful decision if you wanted to save money right away while taking significant and unneeded risks that could have an impact on your product and possibly your customer. We are joking, of course. Quality assurance is crucial, and this section of the article will explain why.</p>\r\n \r\n<p>The disregard of some QA procedures may appear to be a wise decision at first. It\'s because you envision saving money and time to provide new features more quickly. In actuality, every test skipped will lead to later solutions that are considerably more expensive and time-consuming. Your losses will always be greater than your transient gains from such an economy.</p>\r\n<p>We did not conduct the research that led to this list. The data on the image above was gathered from public sources.</p>\r\n \r\n<p>If the aforementioned examples seem out of touch with the realities of your company, reading the following material may help you anticipate the potential problems that may arise in your situation. Neglecting Quality Assurance frequently leads to two different kinds of issues:</p>\r\n\r\n<h6>Issues in Software Development</h6>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Bugs and faults in the code continue to go unnoticed and unfixed.</li>\r\n<li>The system\'s security is in danger.</li>\r\n<li>The overall performance can deteriorate. </li>\r\n<li>The entire system could behave badly.</li>\r\n </ul>\r\n<h6>Business Problems</h6>\r\n \r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Deadlines that are missed as a result of unforeseen issues</li>\r\n<li>The end-pleasure users will be impacted by an app\'s or website\'s poor performance.</li>\r\n<li>Financial losses could result from certain issues.</li>\r\n<li>The majority of the aforementioned issues will harm one\'s reputation.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h5>Quality Assurance\'s Advantages</h5>\r\n<p>Now that you are aware of the risks associated with skipping the QA process, it is crucial to understand the advantages of carrying out this procedure as intended:</p>\r\n \r\n<h6>Reduce costs and time</h6>\r\n \r\n<p>It is simpler to fix bugs when they are discovered early. In addition, it is simpler to prevent issues than to solve them after they arise because future problems can be predicted. As a result, with the right QA procedure, you may release the product without worrying about numerous pointless changes.</p>\r\n\r\n<h6>Competing offering</h6>\r\n \r\n<p>Your product is always preferable to competing for products on the market since it is error-free and performs as intended.</p>\r\n\r\n<h6>Security</h6>\r\n<p>A product with bugs is far more open to attacks than one that functions as intended. This is necessary for the data security of your customers.</p>\r\n \r\n<h6>Reputation</h6>\r\n \r\n<p>One of the things that boost the reputation of your business is a high-quality product. A flawless product is frequently seen as both a quality and a customer-friendly approach in addition to being error-free.</p>\r\n \r\n<p>Another crucial idea is to include quality assurance as a component of the software development lifecycle rather than limiting your project to only software testing as a step.</p>\r\n\r\n<h5>Conclusion</h5>\r\n<p>The truth is that a high-quality product is less obvious than one with flaws. Even though QA professionals\' efforts go frequently undetected, your product will almost surely fail on the market without them. The efforts of QA specialists, on the other hand, lead to a solid and secure product, which is one of the reasons why users prefer it.</p>\r\n \r\n<p>At DotOxygen we consider quality assurance, quality control, and software testing to be necessary components of the software development process, and we also believe that coding should always be done in tandem with QA as part of a holistic strategy. You can get in touch with us if you have any questions regarding our process or if you have an idea for a project.</p>\r\n', '969825-why_quality_assurance_is_important_and_what_are_its_benefits.jpg', 'Branding, Website Design, Website Development, User Interface, User Experience', '2011-08-20 21:00:00.00000', '11.08.2022');
