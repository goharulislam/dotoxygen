      <div className="accordion-body"><p>We work on a variety of UX/UI and web design projects, from creating new products to reworking current mobile apps, websites, and business software. User research, product strategy, user interface, user experience design, usability testing, prototyping, web design, and development are just a few of the services we offer to help you create a successful digital product. Our web design clients are frequently the same firms who employ us for UX/UI design projects, which makes sense since who better describes a product than the people who built it? We're a web design firm that thinks a great website should effectively convert visitors to customers while offering a pleasant web experience consistent with the brand. Higher conversion rates are associated with the excellent UX/UI of a digital product or website. That's why, unlike other design firms, we have UX/UI designers working alongside developers on all projects.</p></div>

The majority of our UX/UI engagements, however, are fixed-price contracts. In this scenario, after learning as much as possible about your project, we'll provide you with a complete proposal. All estimates are based on hourly rates and the estimated number of hours the task will take.</p><p>For example, a typical project might take 10 weeks and cost $150k to $200k. We would build a specific rate card for you based on the team composition for time and materials engagements. We also provide discounted prices to qualified startups.

        <p>Depending on the complexity of the project and the demands the website must satisfy, a website redesign may take 45 to 90 days or longer. A complete redesign may seem like a big task because web design may occasionally appear to be a mysterious art. We begin with a detailed discussion to go through your requirements and provide us with the initial raw materials on which to develop your plan. We will assign homework, based on the discussion, and once we complete your project, we may schedule a meetingâ€”or perhaps twoâ€”to check in. Normally, this procedure takes a few weeks. According to our partners at Blend B2B, a comprehensive research approach is essential to gaining customers and developing the firm's identity.</p>
